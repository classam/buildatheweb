            Like the famous mad philosopher said, when you stare into the void, the void stares also;
            but if you cast into the void, you get a type conversion error.
            (Which just goes to show Nietzsche wasn't a C++ programmer.)

            Helpfiles are traditionally outnumbered by no-help files, which superficially resemble a helpfile
            in form but not in content because they don't actually tell you anything you don't already know,
            or they answer every question except the one you're asking, or you open them and a giant
            animated paper clip leaps out and cheerfully asks where you want to go today. And wikis are worse.
