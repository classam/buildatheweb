        <h1>Header Level One</h1>
        <p>
            There is a philosophy by which many people live their lives,
            and it is this: life is a shit sandwich, but the more bread you've got,
            the less shit you have to eat.
        </p>

        <h2>Header Level Two</h2>
        <p>
            These people are often selfish brats as kids, and they don't get better
            with age: think of the shifty-eyed smarmy asshole from the sixth form
            who grow up to be a merchant banker, or an estate agent, or one of the
            Conservative Party funny-handshake mine's a Rolex brigade.
        </p>

        <h3>Header Level Three</h3>
        <p>
            (This isn't to say that all estate agents, or merchant bankers, or conservatives
            are selfish, but that these are ways of life that provide opportunities
            of a certain disposition to enrich themselves at the expense of others. Bear with me.)
        </p>

        <h4>Header Level Four</h4>
        <p>
            There is another philosophy by which people live their lives,
            and it goes thus: You will do as I say or I will hurt you.
        </p>

        <h5>Header Level Five</h5>
        <p>
            Let me draw you a Venn diagram with two circles on it, denoting sets of individuals.
            They overlap: the greedy ones and the authoritarian ones.
            Let's shade in the intersecting area in a different color and label it: dangerous.
        </p>

        <h6>Header Level Six</h6>
        <p>
            Greed isn't automatically dangerous on its own, and petty authoritarians aren't
            usually dangerous outside their immediate vicinity &mdash; but when you combine the two,
            you get gangsters and dictators and hate-spewing preachers.
        </p>
