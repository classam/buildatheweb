<h1>Hello, world</h1>

<p>
    We're a lazy, inattentive chef, so a sous vide is probably a better purchase than a pressure cooker.

<h2>Sous Vide</h2>

    Sous vide is a cooking technique where we leave a vacuum-sealed bag of our food in hot water for a long time.
    It makes it really hard to overcook our food, because we can forget it for hours and it doesn't matter.
