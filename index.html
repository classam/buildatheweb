    basic programming and computer knowledge, and upgrading you into a web programmer. </p>

            While Richard Stallman is a bit of a dogmatic screwball, the man's seemingly
            able to predict the future with an accuracy we would normally associate with
            prophets, actuaries, or Google.

    <h2> Chapter 1: Request, Response </h2>

    <p>
        Our first chapter is going to focus on what happens behind the scenes when we make
        a web request. What that means is a crash course in computer networking. </p>

    <h3> Uniform Resource Locators </h3>

    <p> Let's start by looking at what happens when we crack open a web browser and
        type in: </p>

    <pre class='code'>https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blinkenlights&amp;action=edit#Etymology</pre>

    <p> This is a <strong>URL</strong>, which stands for <strong>Uniform Resource Locator</strong>.</p>
    
    <div class='aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='left-aside'>
        <h4>URI</h4>
        <p>
        Some people might also call this an URI, but if we encounter a person who does this,
        I recommend that we shun then socially until they stop. </p>
    </div>


    <p> This URL uniquely identifies a document somewhere on someone else's
        computer that we are going to request from that computer. </p>

    <p> This divides into protocol, domain name, path, parameters,
        fragment, locus, and spindle. Memorize all of these terms now. </p>

    <div class='figure'>
        <h3> Fig 1. Dissecting a URL </h3>
	
        <h4>Protocol</h4>
        <p class='code'>
            <strong>https</strong>://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blinkenlights&amp;action=edit#Etymology
        </p>
        <p>
            The protocol describes <strong>how</strong> to connect. 
        </p>

        <h4>Domain Name</h4>
        <p class='code'>
            https://<strong>en.wikipedia.org</strong>/w/index.php?title=Blinkenlights&amp;action=edit#Etymology
        </p>
        <p>
            The domain name describes <strong>where</strong> to connect to. 
        </p>

        <h4>Path</h4>
        <p class='code'>
            https://en.wikipedia.org<strong>/w/index.php</strong>?title=Blinkenlights&amp;action=edit#Etymology
        </p>
        <p>
            The path describes <strong>what</strong> is being requested. 
        </p>

        <h4>Parameters</h4>
        <p class='code'>
        https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php<strong>?title=Blinkenlights&amp;action=edit</strong>#Etymology
        </p>
        <p>
            The parameters describes <strong>extra arguments</strong> for the thing being requested. 
        </p>
            
        <h4>Fragment</h4>
        <p class='code'>
            https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blinkenlights&amp;action=edit<strong>#Etymology</strong>
        </p>
        
        <h4>Locus &amp; Spindle</h4>
        <p class='code'>
            the locus and spindle were in your <strong>heart</strong> the entire time
        </p>
