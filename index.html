    <h2> Introduction </h2>

    <!-- One of the things we'll notice in this book is that I try to address us as 'we'

        <p>
            I'm starting this book assuming that we already know how to program a little bit!
        </p>
        <p>
            To learn to program, I recommend this <em>other</em> open textbook:
            <a href='http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/'>How To Think Like a Computer Scientist</a>.
        </p>

    <p>
        The best kind of textbook about
        the web is made out of <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
        and filled with media and links to other content. That is what
        the web is <em>all about</em>, not dusty ol' textbooks that
        are no longer valid because they cover a version of the web that
        went obsolete nine years ago.
    </p>

        This book was last updated <strong class='book_last_update'>June 21, 2017</strong>.
        If that's a <em>long time ago</em>, I might have died. Avenge me!

        I like to make sometimes humorous, sometimes educational content,
        almost always on the topic of programming.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm a web developer, a Vancouver native, and a <a href='http://cube-drone.com'>cartoonist</a>.

        Sometimes, I make <a href='https://www.youtube.com/user/IkoIkoComic'>videos</a>,

    <h2> Chapter 1: Request, Response </h2>

    <p>
        Our first chapter is going to focus on what happens behind the scenes when we make
        a web request. What that means is a crash course in computer networking.
    </p>

        <h4>Crash Course</h4>

            Grandma's sewing blog so visitor's cursors turn into kittens, though,
            so there's still a <em>job for me to do, here</em>.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3> Uniform Resource Locators </h3>

    <p>
        Let's start by looking at what happens when we crack open a web browser and
        type in:
    </p>

    <pre class='code'>https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blinkenlights&amp;action=edit#Etymology</pre>

    <p> This is a <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>, which stands for <strong>Uniform Resource Locator</strong>.</p>

    <div class='left-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='left-aside aside'>
        <h4>URI</h4>
        <p>
        Some people might also call this an
        <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>, but if we encounter a person who does this,
        I recommend that we shun then socially until they stop. </p>
    </div>


    <p>
        This <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> uniquely identifies a document somewhere on someone else's
        computer that we are going to request from that computer.
    </p>

    <div class='right-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='right-aside aside'>
        <h4>Abbreviations</h4>
        <p>
            If you hold your mouse over an abbreviation like
            <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> for a few seconds,
            the definition of that term should pop up.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        This divides into protocol, domain name, path, parameters,
        fragment, locus, and spindle. Memorize all of these terms now.
    </p>

    <div class='figure'>
        <h3> Dissecting a URL </h3>

        <h4>Protocol</h4>
        <p class='code'>
            <strong>https</strong>://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blinkenlights&amp;action=edit#Etymology
        </p>
        <p>
            The protocol describes <strong>how</strong> to connect.
        </p>

        <h4>Domain Name</h4>
        <p class='code'>
            https://<strong>en.wikipedia.org</strong>/w/index.php?title=Blinkenlights&amp;action=edit#Etymology
        </p>
        <p>
            The domain name describes <strong>where</strong> to connect to.
        </p>

        <h4>Path</h4>
        <p class='code'>
            https://en.wikipedia.org<strong>/w/index.php</strong>?title=Blinkenlights&amp;action=edit#Etymology
        </p>
        <p>
            The path describes <strong>what</strong> is being requested.
        </p>

        <h4>Parameters</h4>
        <p class='code'>
        https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php<strong>?title=Blinkenlights&amp;action=edit</strong>#Etymology
        </p>
        <p>
            The parameters describes <strong>extra arguments</strong> for the thing being requested.
        </p>

        <h4>Fragment</h4>
        <p class='code'>
            https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blinkenlights&amp;action=edit<strong>#Etymology</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            The fragment describe a specific <strong>part</strong> of the document that
            we want to look at.
        </p>

        <h4>Locus &amp; Spindle</h4>
        <p class='code'>
            the locus and spindle were in your <strong>heart</strong> the entire time
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>This is just a bunch of words, describing where we think our document is. How do we actually
        <strong>get</strong> that document?</p>

    <h3> Transport Control Protocol / Internet Protocol </h3>

    <p> Communicating with a far away computer is a process fraught with interesting problems. Problems like: </p>

    <ul>
        <li>How do we make sure that messages reliably arrive?</li>
        <li>How do we make sure that messages arrive in the right order?</li>
        <li>How does our computer communicate with our router?</li>
        <li>How does our router communicate with our modem?</li>
        <li>How do we get messages to travel across a thin strip of copper, or fiberoptic cable, at all?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Most of these problems are quite complicated &mdash; and the lower level we get, the more likely it is
        that we'll need to consult an electrical engineer to explain signal processing theory to us.
        Believe me, that is the <em>last</em> thing that we want.
    </p>

    <p>
        Fortunately, smart people have already solved most of these problems for us.
        The solutions to these problems stack up on top of another &mdash; at the bottom, electrical engineers
        figuring out how to send messages across wires, at the top, math PhDs figuring out how to make sure
        that messages arrive reliably in a fixed order.
    </p>

    <p>
        We have two protocols at the very top of the stack that define how we communicate between computers &mdash;
        <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr>,
        the <strong>Internet Protocol</strong>, which defines how we send messages across the network,
        and <abbr title="Transport Control Procotol">TCP</abbr>, the <strong>Transport Control Protocol</strong>, which makes sure that
        our messsages completely arrive, in the right order, and uncorrupted.
    </p>

    <h3> Protocol &amp; Stack</h3>

    <p>
        I'm going to say the word <strong>protocol</strong> a lot, and it's
        probably important that I establish what that means. In Computing Science,
        we learn the difference between an algorithm and a program &mdash;
        an algorithm describes a specific way of solving a problem,
        whereas a program is the actual code that we need to run the algorithm.
        We could have five different programs, all implementing the same algorithm.
    </p>

    <p> <strong>A protocol is an algorithm for communication</strong>. It delineates the rules of communication. </p>

    <div class='right-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='right-aside aside'>
        <p>
            <strong>C&ndash;3P0</strong> was a protocol droid, because he was programmed with all of the rules
            for communicating with the various different cultures in the Galaxy Far Far Away.
        </p>
        <p> Canonically, C-3P0 was also <em>not very good at this</em>. </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        In the same way that a program is an implementation of an algorithm, a
        <strong>stack</strong> is an implementation of a protocol.
        A protocol is an algorithm, and a stack is a program to implement a protocol.
        So, in order to run
        <abbr title="Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol">TCP/IP</abbr>,
        our computer runs the
        <abbr title="Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol">TCP/IP</abbr> stack,
        which implements the
        <abbr title="Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol">TCP/IP</abbr> protocol. </p>

    <div class='left-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='left-aside aside'>
        <p>
            It has come to my attention that computer people use the word "stack" too often.
        </p>
        <p>
            I keep trying to advance "pile" as an alternative, but it's not taking off.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3> IP Address &amp; Sockets </h3>

    <p>
        The abstraction presented by <abbr title="Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol">TCP/IP</abbr>
        is simple: every computer has an <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address.
        An <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address looks like this: <code>192.0.2.0</code> &mdash; or, like this:
        <code>2001:DB80:c501:17ef:a063:a37f:3803:5c1a</code>. These are just
        identifiers that communicate a unique identity for the computer in question.
    </p>

    <p>
        If we know our <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address, and the
        <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address of the computer that we want to
        communicate with, and that other computer is online, we can trust that
        <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> will
        get the message to that computer. We can use
        <abbr title="Transport Control Protocol">TCP</abbr> to open a <strong>socket</strong> to a specific
        <strong>port</strong> on our target computer.
    </p>

    <div class='figure'>
        <h3>Giant Walls of Plugs</h3>
        <img src="images/ports.png" alt="A giant wall of plugs"/>
        <p>
            Imagine these computers like giant walls of plugs &mdash; or ports &mdash; and when we open a connection,
            <abbr title="Transport Control Protocol">TCP</abbr>
            creates a two way communication link between two ports with a socket on each end.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        There are thousands of these ports &mdash; they're numbered from 1 to 65,535. In order to keep things tidy,
        each different protocol that runs on top of
        <abbr title="Transport Control Protocol">TCP</abbr> usually runs on a different port.
        Of course, most computers aren't communicating on all of these ports at once &mdash;
        in fact, there are six ports that, on most computers, get more use than all
        of the rest of them combined:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>25</strong>, for the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (<abbr title="Simple Mail Transfer Protocol">SMTP</abbr>) </li>
        <li><strong>53</strong>, for the Domain Name System (<abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr>) </li>
        <li><strong>67</strong> and <strong>68</strong> for the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (<abbr title="Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol">DHCP</abbr>) </li>
        <li><strong>80</strong> for the HyperText Transfer Protocol (<abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr>)</li>
        <li><strong>443</strong>, for the HyperText Transfer Protocol over Transport Layer Security (<abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol over Transport Layer Security">HTTPS</abbr>)</li>
    </ul>

    <p> We're going to cover all of these protocols in detail at one point or another. </p>

    <p> For every port that we could contact on a remote computer, there's a program on the remote
        computer that's running, listening, and potentially responding to our requests. </p>

    <h4> Server vs. Client </h4>
    <p>
        A computer that stays connected to the internet all of the time and responds to these
        requests is called a server, and server programming is half of the battle of web programming.
        The second half is client programming, which describes the parts
        of the transaction that occur on the customer's side of things.
    </p>

    <div class='right-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='right-aside small-aside aside'>
        <p>
            The third half of the battle is <strong>lasers</strong>.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3> DHCP </h3>
    <p>
        In order to communicate with a remote server, then, we need three things &mdash;
        our <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address, their <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address,
        and a port number, to communicate with.
    </p>
    <p>
        First of all, let's talk about how we got <strong>our <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> Address</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Well, the short answer is, our computer already knows its <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address. We just ask.
    </p>
    <p>
        How did our computer get its <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address?
        Well, when we connected it to the router &mdash;
        either via <abbr title="Wireless Local Area Networking">WiFi</abbr>
        or by plugging it in &mdash; it communicated to the router, using
        <abbr title="Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol">DHCP</abbr>, the <strong>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</strong>, where
        our computer asked the router to assign it an <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> Address.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then, how did the router that gave us an
        <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address
        get its own <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address?
        Well, when we connected the router to the
        internet, either by plugging it in to a modem or by plugging it in to another link in
        the network, it also communicated to a router, and communicated using
        <abbr title="Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol">DHCP</abbr>.
        It asked
        <em>"What is my IP?"</em>.
    </p>

    <div class='left-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='left-aside small-aside aside'>
        <p>
            How did that router get its <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr>? Magic. It was magic.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Network Address Translation</h3>

    <p>
        If we ask our computer to tell us its
        <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address, it'll probably report something
        that starts with <code>10.0</code> or <code>192.168</code> &mdash; but, if we go to
        Google and ask <em>"what is my IP?"</em>,
        it'll tell us a completely different
        <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address.
    </p>

    <p>
        What gives? How can our computer have more than one
        <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address?
    </p>

    <p>
        As part of our deal with our <abbr title="Internet Service Providers">ISPs</abbr>,
        we usually get just one <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address.
        Just the one. Presumably, we have more than one device in our home &mdash;
        a computer, a cel phone,
        a laptop, a second computer, a smart <abbr title="Television">TV</abbr>,
        a toaster that connects to the internet for some reason,
        a third computer, a toothbrush that connects to the internet for some reason,
        things have really gone out of control lately.
    </p>

    <p>
        All of these devices need to share the one <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address, so, our router creates a little private
        network, just for us, in our home. In this private network, any computer can have any
        <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address
        that it wants. By convention, the <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr>
        addresses for use in private networks start with <code>192.168</code>
        or <code>10.0</code>. Then, when we're connecting to the outside world, our router translates
        our IP address in the private network into our public
        <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is <abbr title="Network Address Translation">NAT</abbr>,
        <strong>Network Address Translation</strong>.
    </p>

    <div class='figure'>
        <p>
            The router creates a private network for all of our devices and
            assigns them local <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> addresses.
        </p>
        <img src='images/nat_1.png' alt="a diagram of a private network">

            When our devices make requests to the internet, the router
            translates them into the public-facing <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address.

        <img src='images/nat_2.png' alt="a diagram of a request being made through the router">

            When the internet responds, the router remembers who requested
            the content and forwards the response back to that
            <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address.

    <h3>Domain Name System</h3>

    <p>
        In order to communicate with a server, we need both our own
        <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address and the
        <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address
        of the computer that we want to communicate with.
    </p>

    <p>
        We have our own <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address &mdash;
        now we need to find the address of the server that we
        want to talk to.
    </p>

    <p> Let's look at the link we're trying to access. </p>

    <p class='code'>
        https://<strong>en.wikipedia.org</strong>/w/index.php?title=Blinkenlights&amp;action=edit#Etymology
    </p>

    <p>
        There's no <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address anywhere in this link. There <strong>is</strong> a domain name,
        <code>en.wikipedia.org</code>
    </p>

    <p>
        In order to find the <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address for this server, we're going to have to start by consulting
        a <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> server.
        <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> stands for <strong>Domain Name System</strong>,
        and the process of converting a domain name into an
        <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address is called
        <strong>name resolution</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        How do we know where the
        <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> server is? When we use
        <abbr title="Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol">DHCP</abbr> to connect to
        <abbr title="Wireless Local Area Networking">WiFi</abbr>, it
        also provides us with the
        <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address of the nearest
        <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> server, which is usually being maintained
        by our
        <abbr title="Internet Service Provider">ISP</abbr>. Acronyms!
    </p>

    <div class='figure'>
        <h3>Turkish Protesters</h3>

        <p>
            Google also maintains a public
            <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr>
            server at the address <code>8.8.8.8</code>, which is good to know
            in case our local
            <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> server ever goes down or is
            <a href="https://mic.com/articles/85987/turkish-protesters-are-spray-painting-8-8-8-8-and-8-8-4-4-on-walls-here-s-what-it-means#.x2HgXBndh">interfered with by a totalitarian government</a>.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        So our computer sends a request to the
        <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> server,
        asking where to find <code>en.wikipedia.org</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        If the server already knows where <code>en.wikipedia.org</code> is, then it responds with the
        IP address. Let's imagine, though, that the server doesn't know.
    </p>

    <div class='right-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='right-aside small-aside aside'>
        <h3>howdns.works</h3>
        <a href="https://howdns.works/"><img src="images/dns_root.png" src="an example image from howdns.works"></a>
        <p> The best way to understand
            <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> is to visit
            <a href='https://howdns.works/'>howdns.works</a>,
            where they illustrate the protocol with fun cartoons. </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> Root servers are distributed all over the globe, and they keep track of
        exactly one thing: the <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> addresses of the computers reponsible for the
        recordkeeping of top level domains, like
        <ul>
            <li><code>.com</code></li>
            <li><code>.net</code></li>
            <li><code>.org</code></li>
            <li><code>.photo</code></li>
            <li><code>.click</code></li>
            <li><code>.ninja</code></li>
            <li><code>.unicorn</code></li>
            <li><code>.fun</code></li>
            <li><code>.ooo</code></li>
            <li><code>.plumbing</code></li>
            <li><code>.oh my god top level domains are just getting dumber and dumber</code></li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        So, the <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> server looks at the domain name we've given it &mdash;
        <code>en.wikipedia.org</code> &mdash;
        sends a request to the root server, and asks
        <em>"which servers can I ask about .org records?"</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        The root server will reply with a list of <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> addresses responsible
        for .org records. These are the addresses of <strong>Top Level Domain Servers</strong>,
        which are maintained by <strong>Domain Registrars</strong>.
        We can pay these people about ten <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> dollars a year to
        create and maintain a record for us,
        so long as nobody else has claimed that domain name already.
        For a pittance, I now own <a href="http://butts.work">http://butts.work</a>.
    </p>

    <div class='left-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='left-aside aside'>
        <p>
            Some people claim that the <strong>most important tool in web programming</strong>
            is a command line or a text editor,
            but I will maintain that it is a <strong>credit card</strong>.
    </div>

    <p>
        Finally, the <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> server queries the wikipedia nameservers, asking them
        where they can find <code>en</code>.
        If we paid a registrar to put up a domain name for us,
        they'll usually throw in a nameserver for free &mdash;
        all we have to do is write some <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr>
        rules that tell the nameserver what
        <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address we want to point at.
    </p>

    <p>
        <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> rules are written in a cryptic language that contains records
        with names like <code>A</code>, <code>MX</code>, <code>AAAA</code>,
        and <code>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH SPIDERS</code> &mdash;
        I'm sorry, there was a spider next to the keyboard.
    </p>

    <p>
        So, Wikipedia's nameservers report that en.wikipedia.org is
        located at, say, <code>203.0.113.98</code>.
        Finally, after that entire protracted process, we know where wikipedia is.
    </p>

    <div class='right-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='right-aside small-aside aside'>
        <p>
            Because I wrote this in the <em>past</em>, that's bound
            to change and has definitely changed already.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3>HyperText Transfer Protocol</h3>

    <p>
        Our next step is to use <abbr title="Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol">TCP/IP</abbr> to create a connection between our
        <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address,
        and the <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address that we just resolved from
        <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr>.
    </p>

    <p>
        There's only one thing left that we need &mdash; a port number.
        We also didn't specify a port number as part of the
        <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>,
        but we did specify a protocol,
        <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol over Transport Layer Security">HTTPS</abbr> &mdash;
        the <strong>HyperText Transfer Protocol feat. Transport Layer Security</strong> &mdash;
        and when we specify a protocol without a port number,
        our connection automatically goes to the default port for that protocol.
        In the case of <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol over Transport Layer Security">HTTPS</abbr>,
        that's <strong>443</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
    The <strong>HyperText Transfer Protocol (<abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr>)</strong> is the protocol responsible
        for moving documents around. Request a document? Get a document.
        The rules for that are laid out in the HyperText Transfer Protocol,
        which is the protocol that powers pretty much the entire web as we know it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>'s
        protocol is <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol over Transport Layer Security">HTTPS</abbr>, though, not just
        <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr>. The difference is slight
        but important &mdash;
        <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol over Transport Layer Security">HTTPS</abbr>
        is the same as
        <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr>, but over a connection encrypted
        with <strong>Transport Layer Security
            (<abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr>)</strong>.
        This prevents J. Random Hacker from watching every
        <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> request that goes by.
    </p>
    <div class='right-aside-arrow'> </div>

    <p>
        Once we've created this encrypted communication path between our computer
        and the faraway server, we need to construct a
        <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> Request. It'll look
        something like this:
    </p>

    <pre class='code'>
GET /w/index.php?title=Blinkenlights&amp;action=edit#Etymology HTTP/1.1
Host: en.wikipedia.org</pre>

    <p>
        This is a request to <code>GET</code> whatever's at the path
        of the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> we provided to our browser.
    </p>

    <p>
        It also includes <strong>Headers</strong> with the request &mdash; sets of key
        and value that communicate extra information to the server. In this case,
        the only header we've included is "Host".
    </p>

    <p>
        The server will receive this request, and respond with a
        <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> Response
        containing the sweet webpage we've been looking for this entire time.
    </p>

    <p>
        Virtually everything in web programming happens in the space between
        the <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> request and the
        <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> response. Figuring out how to respond,
        quickly,
        with the right stuff is the meat and potatoes of web programming.
        This bit, right here. It's all the marbles. Empires have risen
        and fallen, all dependant on the simple gap of how a server converts
        this <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> request into a
        <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> response.
    </p>

    <p>
        And then, Wikipedia responds. The full
        <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> response is several
        pages long, we can look at it <a href='wikipedia_http_response'>here</a>.
        In order to keep my book neat and tidy, though, I'm going to
        concoct a fake response for the sake of example:
    </p>

        After the

        version and status code, there are <strong>Headers</strong>
        again. These headers describe important properties of the file that's

    </p>

    <pre class='code'>
Content-language: en

        but we can add

        which is how we can sneak in <a href='http://www.gnuterrypratchett.com/'>the clacks</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        After the <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> version and status code, we get into a big patch
        of <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.
        How do we know that it's
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>? Well, the <code>Content-type</code>
        header referred to this as <code>text/html</code>, so we can be
        pretty sure that we've got a big handful of
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.
    </p>

    <h3> Hypertext Markup Language </h3>

    <p>
        I'm going to do a dramatic reading of a passage from
        "In The Beginning Was The Command Line".
        Despite being almost 20 years old, it's a stonkingly accurate
        diatribe on computer culture and a fun historical record from
        <em>the before times</em>.
    </p>

    <blockquote cite="http://artlung.com/smorgasborg/C_R_Y_P_T_O_N_O_M_I_C_O_N.shtml">
        <p>
            This crud is called <strong>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</strong>
            and it is basically
            a very simple programming language instructing your web browser how
            to draw a page on a screen. Anyone can learn HTML and many people do.
            The important thing is that no matter what splendid multimedia
            web pages they might represent, HTML files are just telegrams.
        </p>

        <p>
            When Ronald Reagan was a radio announcer, he used to call baseball
            games by reading the terse descriptions that trickled in over the
            telegraph wire and were printed out on a paper tape. He would sit there,
            all by himself in a padded room with a microphone, and the paper
            tape would eke out of the machine and crawl over the palm of
            his hand printed with cryptic abbreviations. If the count went
            to three and two, Reagan would describe the scene as he saw it
            in his mind's eye: "The brawny left-hander steps out of the
            batter's box to wipe the sweat from his brow. The umpire steps
            forward to sweep the dirt from home plate." and so on.
            When the cryptogram on the paper tape announced a base hit,
            he would whack the edge of the table with a pencil, creating
            a little sound effect, and describe the arc of the ball as if
            he could actually see it. His listeners, many of whom presumably
            thought that Reagan was actually at the ballpark watching the game,
            would reconstruct the scene in their minds according to his descriptions.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is exactly how the World Wide Web works: the HTML files are
            the pithy description on the paper tape,
            and your Web browser is Ronald Reagan.

            As of 2004, only 5 years after the original publication,
            Neil Stephenson regarded it as badly out of date.

        <p>
            Another author, with permission, published an

    <p>
        So, the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
        that Wikipedia has returned to us contains a description of
        the content that we're looking at, and then our web browser
        renders it into a webpage.
    </p>

    <p>
        It would seem like, here, our journey is complete.
        We've made a round trip between our device and the server, and we're done
        &mdash; but, not quite! When the browser renderer gets to this part of the
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>:
    </p>

    <pre class='code'>
&lt;img src=&rdquo;https://media0.giphy.com/media/K5Yn9JCXcrXr2/giphy.gif&rdquo;/&gt;</pre>

    <p>
        This image tag references content that exists at another
        <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>.
        And so, we kick off this entire process again, from start to finish,
        to get whatever it is at that new address. The trick is, though,
        instead of sending us
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>,
        this server will respond with an animated image.
        Modern web-pages may require dozens of requests to various images
        and scripts before they're completely rendered.

    <h3> Chapter 1 Summary</h3>

    <p>Every browser request&ndash;response goes a little something like this: </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Our browser uses <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> to resolve the
            <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>'s
            domain into an <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address.
        </li>
        <li>
            Our browser uses <abbr title="Transport Control Protocol">TCP</abbr>

        <li>
            Our browser sends a <abbr title="HyperText Transport Protocol">HTTP</abbr>

    <h2> Chapter 2: Hello, World </h2>

    <p>Theory is fun, but do you know what would be more fun? </p>

    <p>Getting a server up and running!</p>

    <p>By tradition, when computering, our first program is always a program to print
        out 'hello, world'. </p>

    <div class='figure'>
        <img src='images/tattoo_1.jpg' alt='hello world, being tattooed on my arm'/>
        <p>
            You could, of course, broadcast the message "hello, world" by tattooing
            it on your arm, as I have, but perhaps we should start with a less
            permanent solution to the problem.
        </p>

        <h3>Hello, world</h3>
        <p>
            "Hello, world" is important to me (as you might have guessed), as a symbol
            of learning by starting small.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even experienced programmers start with "hello, world" in a new environment.
            It's a great way to make sure that everything is configured properly.
        </p>
        <p>
            The tradition started with Brian Kernighan at Bell Labs, with the introduction
            of the C Language.

    </div>

    <p>
        This chapter is going to cover a lot of topics <em>very loosely</em> in order to
        get us to a workable initial state. Don't worry &mdash; we'll be covering everything,
        in depth, eventually.
    </p>

    <p>
        We're going to be doing everything &mdash; absolutely everything &mdash; from
        a Linux command line.
    </p>

    <p>
        Both of these choices &mdash; Linux, and the command line &mdash; might seem
        a little strange. Let's dig into them a bit.
    </p>

        <h3>GNU/Linux</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/why-gnu-linux.en.html">Some people</a>
            believe that Linux should be called "GNU/Linux", on account of
            Linux was partially built using tools provided by the GNU project.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, if all things were named the way that they should be named,
            IKEA would be called "Garbage Furniture Store" and all sandwiches
            would be "Mayonnaise Sandwich" because without the mayonnaise they
            are not really sandwiches at all.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3> Linux </h3>

    <p>
        Fully half of web programming is server programming. In order to program
        a server, we're going to need a server &mdash; a computer that stays online all
        the time and responds to client requests.
    </p>

    <p>
        We could use our home computer as a server, but:
        <ul>
            <li>Windows and Mac operating systems have an awkward tendency to
                reboot themselves to install security updates and add features,
                and this is not optional. </li>
            <li>A home computer has all of its security defaults set in a way
                that would be appropriate for a computer on a home network,
                not a computer exposed to the tireless onslaught of the
                public internet. </li>
                <li>Unless we pay our <abbr title="Internet Service Provider">ISP</abbr>
                extra for a static <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address, our
                home's <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr>
                address changes regularly, which means that it
                will be difficult to find our computer. </li>
            <li>Our home computer likely contains our own, personal, private information. </li>
            <li>Doing other stuff on our home computer, like opening 80 browser tabs
                while playing video games, could affect the performance of our server. </li>
    <div class='right-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='right-aside small-aside aside'>
        <p>Only 80 tabs?</p>
        <p>You are like a little <strong>baby</strong>.</p>
    </div>
            <li> Unless we happen to have a home fibre connection, it's likely
                that we're on an asymmetric connection to the internet &mdash; with downloads
                <em>much</em> faster than uploads. For a server, though, it is the upload
                speed that matters; serving a lot of traffic from our home internet
                connection would be like trying to operate a Denny's through a foot-wide hole
                &mdash; possible, but frustrating once we have more than one or two customers.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        These are not insurmountable problems, and building a home server out of a
        spare computer is a fun and instructive project that I highly recommend.
    </p>

    <p>
        With the home computer out as a server option, that leaves us renting server time
        from someone else.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are lots of reasons that we might choose Linux over Windows if we're
        planning on running a server for a long time. Linux is lightweight. Linux is secure.
        Linux is able to stay online for a very long time. The reason
        for Linux's popularity as a server is very simple, though: <strong>Linux is free</strong>,
        which generally makes server Linux the most cost-effective option.
    </p>

        <h3>Free or Four</h3>
        <p>
            In software, there are two meanings of free.
        </p>

        <p>
            The first meaning is the obvious one, and the correct one:
            free means "we don't have to pay for it".
        </p>

        <p>
            But there's the other meaning of free, meaning the code
            is <em>wild and free like an unbroken stallion</em>.
            This is an alternative definition of free that has to do with
            our freedom to legally take the code, modify it as we please,
            and share it with others. Linux is also free in this way.
        </p>

        <p>
            Many systems are one kind of free but not another - GitHub, for example,
            is don't-have-to-pay free but not freeeeeeedom!-free, whereas Red Hat Linux
            is freeeedom!-free but we still have to pay money dollars for it.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h4>"It's a UNIX system! I know this!"</h4>

    <p>
        Linux, like Mac OS X, is based on Unix, an operating system with an
        almost half-century of history, only some of which involves
        <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/06/tech-time-warp-time-unix-saved-day-jurassic-park/">velociraptors</a>.
        That half-century can be a double-edged
        sword &mdash; the reason for strange design decisions is often shrouded
        in some ancient
        <a href="http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_kb_shortcuts_pain.html">obscure keyboard layout</a>.
    </p>

    <div class='left-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='left-aside aside'>
        <h3>Bell Labs &amp; Unix</h3>
        <p>
            If we're at all interested in computing history &mdash; and why
            wouldn't we be, it's the <em>best history</em> &mdash; we're
            going to hear Bell Labs come up a lot.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was created by Alexander Graham Bell in 1925, as the
            "Volta Laboratory and Bureau", a private research laboratory,
            and has changed hands numerous times since then.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since opening, the laboratory has been responsible for eight
            different Nobel prizes between 1937 and 2014 &mdash; which gives
            it more Nobel laureates than the University of British Columbia.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bell Labs invented transistors in the fifties, invented
            <abbr title="Charge-coupled Device">CCD</abbr>s in 2009,
            and, in the sixties, discovered the cosmic background radiation that validated
            the existence of the Big Bang.
        </p>
        <p>
            Oh, and during a brief lull in the seventies, Bell Labs created
            Unix and C, the most successful operating system and
            programming language in the world.
        </p>
        <p> Way to go, Bell Labs. </p>

    </div>

    <h4>Linux Distributions</h4>
    <p>
        One confusing thing about Linux is that we can't just crack open a laptop
        and start running Linux on it &mdash; in fact, Linux really refers to
        <strong>The Linux Kernel</strong>, which is the tiny beating heart
        of the operating system.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are lots of things that we think of as part of an operating system
        &mdash; the window system, a desktop environment, the software that
        comes pre-installed on the system, device drivers, installers,
        Minesweeper &mdash; but the Linux Kernel doesn't come with any of these
        things.
    </p>

    <p>
        So, the complete kit required to make a computer actually do computer
        things is called a <strong>Linux Distribution</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Popular distributions
        include <strong>Ubuntu</strong>, <strong>Red Hat/Fedora</strong>, <strong>Mint</strong>,
        <strong>Slackware</strong>, and <strong>Arch</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Different distributions focus on different priorities.
        Some, like <strong>Mint</strong>, focus on being easy to use as a desktop OS.
        <strong>Arch</strong> is highly configurable and optimizable, and
        popular with the sort of people who drive a 1996 Nissan 300ZX Turbo
        with a gigantic aftermarket spoiler and undercar lights.
    </p>

    <div class='right-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='right-aside aside'>
        <p>
            Gentoo is for the sort of people who would buy the Arch user's car,
            then take the aftermarket spoiler and lights off.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        <strong>Ubuntu</strong> started out resolutely trying to conquer the
        desktop <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr>
        market, but after a decade of mostly failing to do so, has
        seemingly embraced its position as a competitive and pretty comprehensive
        server operating system. I like Ubuntu, a lot, and it's the
        distribution I'm going to be using as an example distribution.
    </p>

    <h3> The Command Line & The Secure Shell </h3>

    <p>
        Most systems work is still done with the command line.
    </p>

    <p>
        While I'd love to say that this is because the command line is
        inherently superior to all other methods of interaction
        with a computer, the actual reasons are simple:
        <ul>
            <li>
                It's easier to write a command line program than a
                <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> program.
            </li>
            <li>
                <abbr title="Secure Shell">SSH</abbr>
            </li>
        </ul>

    <div class='left-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='left-aside aside'>
        <p>
            What's a librarian's favourite shell command?
            <abbr title="Secure Shell">SSH</abbr>.
        </p>
    </div>
    </p>

    <p>
        <abbr title="Secure Shell">SSH</abbr>, or <strong>Secure Shell</strong>,
        is one of the most important tools in our web programming arsenal.
        <abbr title="Secure Shell">SSH</abbr> is a tool allowing for remote control of computers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most Linux distributions run the <abbr title="Secure Shell">SSH</abbr> daemon in the background, all the time,
        and it's possible to log in to the computer directly with a username and
        password.
    </p>
    <div class='right-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='right-aside aside'>
        <p>
            <strong>Daemon</strong> is the Unix term for a program that runs in the background,
            without user intervention.
        </p>
        <p> Windows, perhaps wanting to divorce itself from the theological implications of
            having a legion of demons under the hood, calls these services instead. </p>
    </div>
    </p>

    <p>
        But the <abbr title="Secure Shell">SSH</abbr> interface to a Linux computer doesn't come with any fancy doodads
        or graphical user interfaces. Nope, dad-gummit, we have to control the system
        by pulling up our suspenders, tying an onion to our belts, walking uphill
        both ways, and using the command line interface.
    </p>

    <div class='left-aside-arrow'> </div>

            And in those days, nickels had pictures of bumblebees on them. Give me five bees for a quarter, you'd say.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now where were we? Oh yeah, the important thing was that I had an onion on my belt, which was the style
            at the time. They didn't have white onions, becuase of the war. The only thing that you could
            get was those big yellow ones.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3> Let's Get This Terrible Party Started </h3>

    <p>
        First and foremost, we are going to need access to a command line.
    </p>

    <p>
        If we're running Mac OS X, we can get to a command line, right now,
        by opening the "Terminal" program &mdash; although
        downloading <a href="https://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a> gets us tabs and splits.
    </p>

    <div class='right-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='right-aside aside'>
        <h3>Tabs &amp; Splits</h3>
        <p>
            When we work with terminals, sooner or later we're going to have 10 of them open
            at once. When this starts happening, having the ability to split them out
            into separate tabs starts to become <em>way convenient</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have a wide screen, it's also nice to be able to split the
            terminal in half and have <em>twice as many terminals</em>.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        If we're running Windows, we can download <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>.
        We're going to need Git anyways, it's the most widely used source control
        tool on the market, but it also comes with the <em>easiest to configure unix-like console
        available in Windows</em>.
    </p>

    <div class='left-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='left-aside small-aside aside'>
        <p>
            Yeah, move over, Cygwin.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        If we're not in a hurry, we also might spend some time configuring
        <a href="https://conemu.github.io/">ConEmu</a> to
        <a href="https://gist.github.com/n3dst4/cc875d83401c06bd6faa">work with Git Bash</a>.
        This gets us the tabs and the splits.
    </p>
    <div class='right-aside-arrow'> </div>


    <h3>Code Directory & Project Root</h3>
    <p>
        Somewhere on our computer is our <strong>home directory</strong>. This is the root
        for all of our personal files. In Windows, my home directory lives at
        <code>C:\Users\Curtis</code>, whereas in Mac OS X, the home directory lives
        in <code>/users/curtis</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm fond of creating a directory, <code>code</code>, under the home root, as
        my project root. Every different project I'm working on lives in this directory.
        Then, I configure my terminal to open this directory when it starts up.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's open our terminal &mdash; be it Terminal, iTerm2, Git Bash, or ConEmu.
    </p>

    <div class='right-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='right-aside small-aside aside'>
        <h3> Shell Game </h3>
        <p>
            Technically, the <strong>terminal</strong> is the window that shows you
            the <strong>shell</strong>, which is the program that actually handles
            your interactions with the command prompt.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Bash</strong> is the Bourne Again Shell, the most common shell
            for Linux systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>SSH</strong> is the Secure Shell, a shell to remote systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>sh</strong> stands for "Shell", and it refers to whatever
            is the default shell on a system.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>dash</strong> is a lightweight shell without the features
            and functionality of Bash. In Debian and Ubuntu, <code>/bin/sh</code>
            points to dash instead of bash, but bash is still the default shell
            for users.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class='figure'>
        <img src='images/chapter2/terminal_1.png' alt="a terminal window"/>
        <p>dat's some good terminal</p>
    </div>

    <p>
        We're staring a <strong>command prompt</strong> in the face. That <code>$</code>
        means that the terminal is ready for us to enter a command.
    </p>

    <h3>Let's Putter Around In The Terminal A Bit</h3>

    <p>
        I'm excited! I get to tell you about the <strong>most important</strong> shell commands!
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's start by asking where we are, using the <strong>print working directory</strong> command,
        <code>pwd</code>.
    </p>

    <pre class='code'>
<span class='machine'>curtis@SMOKESTACK</span> <span class='path'>~/code</span>
<span class='prompt'>$</span> pwd
/c/Users/curtis/code</pre>


    <h4> Tilde Swinton</h4>

    <p>
        So, we're at <code>/c/Users/curtis/code</code>, but the terminal says that
        we're at <code>~/code</code>. What's the deal?

        <h3> Symbol Puns </h3>
        <p>
            Part of the elaborate online story
            <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6">Homestuck</a>

            different threads of execution</em>, which
            is a pretty <del>awesome</del> hilarious idea.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's unfortunate that
            the language's <em>unbounded runtime</em>
            and <em>fictional nature</em>
            render the programming
            language almost completely useless.

        <code>~</code>(tilde) is shorthand for "home".
        Since our home is <code>/c/Users/curtis</code>, <code>~/code</code>
        is shorthand for <code>/c/Users/curtis/code</code>.
    </p>

    <h4> MSYS </h4>
    <p>
        Follow-up question: why is it <code>/c/Users/curtis/code</code>
        and not <code>C:\Users\curtis\code</code>?
    </p>

    <p>
        Simulating Bash on Windows requires a layer to translate Windows concepts
        into vaguely-Linux-shaped concepts. This is provided by MinGW &mdash; Minimalist GNU for Windows
        &mdash; and MSYS, which is a collection of utilities like Bash ported to run on MinGW.
    </p>

    <p>
        Linux doesn't support lettered-drive roots like <code>C:</code>, instead prefering
        to have a single root for all drives, <code>/</code>.
        Linux also uses forward slashes instead of backslashes.
    </p>

    <p>
        MSYS and MinGW do this conversion for us, but the differences between Windows
        and Linux are going to continue to bite us all the way throughout this journey.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mac OS X, being built on top of a Unix system called "Darwin", doesn't suffer from
        these problems.
    </p>

    <h4>Terminal Commands</h4>

    <p>
        Using the <strong>change directory</strong> command, <code>cd</code>, we can change
        our directory.
    </p>

    <pre class='code'>
<span class='machine'>curtis@SMOKESTACK</span> <span class='path'>~/code</span>
<span class='prompt'>$</span> cd ~

<span class='machine'>curtis@SMOKESTACK</span> <span class='path'>~</span>
<span class='prompt'>$</span> pwd
/c/users/curtis
</pre>

    <p> Look, we're home, now! </p>

    <p> We can navigate to a specific directory: </p>

    <div class='left-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='left-aside aside'>
        <h4> The Root Directory </h4>
        <p>
            The <code>/</code> directory is at the very base of
            the filesystem tree, and thus, is the "root" directory.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Root" is an overloaded term in the Linux world, because
            just about everything is modelled as some kind of tree
            structure. There's also a root <em>user</em>, and that's
            a completely different thing that doesn't have anything
            to do with the filesystem.
        </p>
    </div>

    <pre class='code'>
<span class='machine'>curtis@SMOKESTACK</span> <span class='path'>~</span>
<span class='prompt'>$</span> cd /

<span class='machine'>curtis@SMOKESTACK</span> <span class='path'>/etc</span>
<span class='prompt'>$</span>
</pre>

    <p> And we can use <code>ls</code> to display the contents of a directory: </p>

    <pre class='code'>
<span class='machine'>curtis@SMOKESTACK</span> <span class='path'>/etc</span>
<span class='prompt'>$</span> cd ~

    <p>Whoa. There's a lot of stuff in my home directory.</p>

    <p>If there's no code directory in here, yet, we can make one, with <code>mkdir</code></p>

    <pre class='code'>
<span class='machine'>curtis@SMOKESTACK</span> <span class='path'>~</span>
<span class='prompt'>$</span> mkdir code
mkdir: cannot create directory 'code': File exists
</pre>

    <p>That doesn't work, because in my case, the code directory already exists. </p>

    <p>Here's a good trick. Type in <code> cd c</code> and then hit the tab key.</p>

    <pre class='code'>
<span class='machine'>curtis@SMOKESTACK</span> <span class='path'>~</span>
<span class='prompt'>$</span> cd code

<span class='machine'>curtis@SMOKESTACK</span> <span class='path'>~/code</span>
<span class='prompt'>$</span>
    </pre>

    <p>The terminal should auto-complete to the first thing that starts with a 'c'. If you press tab again, it'll
        auto-complete to the second thing that starts with a 'c'. This is a very useful tool. </p>

    <p> Let's create a directory for our hello world program. </p>

    <pre class='code'>
<span class='machine'>curtis@SMOKESTACK</span> <span class='path'>~/code</span>

<span class='machine'>curtis@SMOKESTACK</span> <span class='path'>~/code</span>
<span class='prompt'>$</span> ls
hello_world
    </pre>

    <p> Now let's delete that directory and then recreate it, just to be contrary. </p>

    <pre class='code'>
<span class='machine'>curtis@SMOKESTACK</span> <span class='path'>~/code</span>
<span class='prompt'>$</span> rmdir hello_world

<span class='machine'>curtis@SMOKESTACK</span> <span class='path'>~/code</span>
<span class='prompt'>$</span> ls

<span class='machine'>curtis@SMOKESTACK</span> <span class='path'>~/code</span>
<span class='prompt'>$</span> mkdir hello_world

<span class='machine'>curtis@SMOKESTACK</span> <span class='path'>~/code</span>
<span class='prompt'>$</span> ls
hello_world
    </pre>

    <p> We can use <code>cd</code> to jump in to the folder we've just created, and we can also
        use <code>cd</code> with the special shortcut <code>..</code> to go up a level. </p>

    <pre class='code'>
<span class='machine'>curtis@SMOKESTACK</span> <span class='path'>~/code</span>
<span class='prompt'>$</span> cd hello_world

<span class='machine'>curtis@SMOKESTACK</span> <span class='path'>~/code/hello_world</span>
<span class='prompt'>$</span> cd ..

<span class='machine'>curtis@SMOKESTACK</span> <span class='path'>~/code</span>
<span class='prompt'>$</span> cd ..

<span class='machine'>curtis@SMOKESTACK</span> <span class='path'>~/</span>
<span class='prompt'>$</span>
hello_world
    </pre>

    <p> That feels like a pretty solid introduction to the command line. With these simple
        tools we can zip around the filesystem creating directories like a pro!</p>

    <h3> Installing Ubuntu </h3>
    <p>
        This used to be a process that involved either running both Ubuntu and Windows/Mac OS X
        on our primary computer, and switching from one to the other when we boot
        up the computer &mdash; or, finding a junky old computer from around the house
        and installing Ubuntu on that.
    </p>
    <div class='left-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='left-aside aside'>
        <p>
            There's also
            <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about">Bash on Ubuntu on Windows Subsystem for Linux</a>, which
            is a new and exciting way to install Ubuntu on Windows, but it's
            still <em>very beta</em>.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        With Virtual Machines, though, it's possible to run Ubuntu from within our primary operating
        system. So we should definitely do that.
        In fact, the toolset for doing this has become so easy to use that I've started
        running a <em>different virtual machine for every project I'm working on</em>.
    </p>
    <div class='right-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='right-aside small-aside aside'>
        <p>
            I built a computer with 32GB of RAM just to make this practical, although
            I could also <em>just remember to turn the virtual machines off once in a while</em>.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        The tools that make this easy and free are <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>
        and <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>. Download and install these programs.
    </p>

    <h4>VirtualBox &amp; Vagrant</h4>

    <p>
        VirtualBox is software to run virtual machines. We could get away with
        just using VirtualBox in our quest to install Ubuntu, but that would take
        a lot of effort and clicking.
    </p>

    <p>
        Vagrant is a wrapper around VirtualBox that provides a very hackable
        command line interface and a gigantic repository of pre-created
        operating system images. Installing an operating system with Vagrant
        can be as easy as just picking it out of a catalogue and modifying a text
        file.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of the things I like most about Vagrant is that it's possible to configure
        the entire operating system automatically. Instead of laboriously hand-configuring
        the operating system every time we move to a new machine or accidentally bork
        a database, we can just incinerate the virtual machine clean and summon a new one.
    </p>

    <p>Let's go back to our new 'hello_world' directory and type in <code>vagrant init</code></p>

    <pre class='code'>
<span class='machine'>curtis@SMOKESTACK</span> <span class='path'>~/code</span>
<span class='prompt'>$</span> cd hello_world

<span class='machine'>curtis@SMOKESTACK</span> <span class='path'>~/code/hello_world</span>
<span class='prompt'>$</span> vagrant init
A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory. You are now
ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please
read the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation
on `vagrantup.com` for more information on using Vagrant.
    </pre>

    <p>
        <code>vagrant init</code> creates for us a <strong>Vagrantfile</strong>. This file
        describes all of the important details about the operating system we are about
        to create &mdash; which Linux distribution we want, networking details, how much
        <abbr title="Random Access Memory">RAM</abbr> it gets to use, and even, if we configure it right, the instructions for
        setting up all of the software that runs on the operating system.
    </p>

    <p>Now it's time to open up the Vagrantfile in a text editor. </p>

    <div class='right-aside-arrow short-arrow'></div>
    <div class='right-aside aside'>
        <h4>Text Editor</h4>
        <p>
            I'm just going to assume that you have a programmer's text editor on your
            computer that you like and are familiar with.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you don't, go install <strong>Notepad++</strong> or <strong>SublimeText</strong>
            or maybe <strong>Atom</strong>.

        <p>

        <p>
            We're going to replace <code>"base"</code> with <code>"ubuntu/xenial64"</code>.

            This is where we forward port 8080 on our outer computer to port 80 on the
            virtual machine, by uncommenting this line.

    <h5>Picking a Box</h5>

    <p>
        In order to boot up an operating system, first, we have to pick a
        <em>base box</em> &mdash; this is the blank, untouched, pristine
        operating system that we are going to be working with.
    </p>

    <p>
        A catalogue of base boxes exists <a href="https://atlas.hashicorp.com/boxes/search">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        We're going to choose <code>ubuntu/xenial64</code>.
    </p>
    <div class='right-aside-arrow'></div>
    <div class='right-aside aside'>
        <h4>Xenial Xerus</h4>
        <p>
            Every release of Ubuntu has been paired with an Alliterative Animal name,
            and they've been in alphabetical order
            from 5.10 (Breezy Badger) all the way up to 17.04 (Zesty Zapus).
        </p>
        <p>
            Every 4 years, Ubuntu also releases a <strong>LTS</strong> "Long Term Support"
            version of Ubuntu, which is scheduled to keep getting attention and
            security updates for 5 years after it launches. Xenial Xerus, 16.04, is the
            most recent LTS version of Ubuntu, which is why we picked it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, they're rolling around to the front of the alphabet again.
        </p>
        <p>
            One tradition when rolling through the alphabet is to go "X", "Y", "Z", "AA", "BB".
        <p>
            They've
            managed to find an "AA" animal, the "Artful Aardvark".
        <p>
            "BB" might B a little harder.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p> The line in the Vagrantfile pertaining to boxes will read: </p>

    <pre>
    <code class='ruby'>
# Every Vagrant development environment requires a box. You can search for
# boxes at https://atlas.hashicorp.com/search.
config.vm.box = "ubuntu/xenial64"
    </code>
    </pre>

    <h5>Forwarding Port 80</h5>

    <p>
        The virtual machine is going to be running a web server (spoiler alert)
        on port 80. The only problem with that? The ports on the virtual machine
        aren't accessible by default. We need to write a rule to connect
        a port on our outer machine to a port on the virtual machine.
    </p>

    <p>
        By convention, <code>8080</code> is popular port for developing
        <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> services,
        so we're going to use that.
    </p>

    <p>
        The VagrantFile already had this option ready for us &mdash; all we have to do
        is remove the <code>#</code> character to turn the line from a comment into
        real code.
    </p>

    <pre>
    <code class='ruby'>
# Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
# within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
# accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080
    </code>
    </pre>

    <h5>Syncing a Folder</h5>

    <p>
        This is a more advanced feature, but one that's going to allow
        us to edit our codebase on the virtual machine with
        a graphical text editor on our host machine, and
        that seems like it's going to be worth the effort.
    </p>

    <p>
        First of all, let's create a folder to sync.

    <p>
        Then, let's sync that folder to a location within the virtual machine.
    </p>

    <p>
        We could choose just about any location, but if we were to do something like
        "accidentally sync over a bunch of important system files", we would be in
        for a world of trouble.
    </p>

    <p>
        One spot that's generally safe is <code>/home/ubuntu/something</code>.
        Vagrant boxes usually come with one user operating on them, already.
        This one comes with a user named <code>ubuntu</code>, and that user's home
        directory is <code>/home/ubuntu</code>, which means we can put anything
        in there that we want.
    </p>

<code>
# Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is

config.vm.synced_folder "html", "/home/ubuntu/html"
</pre>
</code>

    <h5> Pull the Lever, Kronk </h5>

    <p> Save the Vagrantfile and we're ready to get started! </p>

    <p> Let's turn the Virtual Machine on, with <code>vagrant up</code>.</p>

    <pre class='code'>
<span class='machine'>curtis@SMOKESTACK</span> <span class='path'>~/code/hello_world</span>
<span class='prompt'>$</span> vagrant up

            Sometimes instead of good things, we'll see
            <code>VT-x/AMD-V hardware acceleration is not available on your system.
                Your 64-bit guest will fail to detect a 64-bit CPU and will not be able to boot.</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a bad thing. There are three things we might need to do to get this working:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Turn on <abbr title="Intel Virtualization">VT-x</abbr>/<abbr title="Advanced Micro Devices Virtualization">AMD-V</abbr>

            </ol>
        </p>

    <p>
        This is a whole new command line. The command line of the Ubuntu Virtual Machine.
        We've got an Ubuntu server running inside our computer!
    </p>

    <p>
        Take a moment for a brief celebration.
    </p>

    <h3> Installing a Web Server </h3>

    <p>
        We're not done, yet. Our server is running, yes, and we've made sure that,
        if it listens on port 80, we can connect to it.
    </p>

    <p>
        One problem, though &mdash; the server isn't listening on port 80.
        This is just a server, right now. We need to install a <strong>web server</strong>
        on our server server.
    </p>

    <p>
        We can do that with the command <code>sudo apt-get install nginx</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Whoa. There's a lot of stuff happening in that command. Let's unpack that a bit!
    </p>

    <h4>sudo</h4>

    <p>
        <code>sudo</code> stands for "<strong>su</strong>peruser <strong>do</strong>".
    </p>

    <p>
        Linux is, by nature, a multi-user operating system. It's designed to have
        many users logged in at once.
    </p>

    <div class='right-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='right-aside aside'>
        <h4>Mainframe</h4>
        <p>
            This is a holdover from the mainframe era of computing, where
            there was only money for one computer (which filled an entire room)
            and every user had a physical terminal connected to that
            computer with their own login and home directory.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        In order to keep users from being able to access each other's files,
        each file has a set of <strong>permissions</strong> that defines
        who is able to see it, and many system functions are locked down
        so that common users can't touch them.
    </p>

    <p>
        <code>sudo</code> is a way of saying "I am the administrator and I can do whatever I like".
    </p>

    <div class='figure'>
        <img src="images/chapter2/sandwich.png" alt="The 'sudo make me a sandwich' comic from XCKD'"/>
    </div>

    <p>
        Not everybody has access to sudo &mdash; only admin users.
    </p>

    <div class='figure'>
        <img src="images/chapter2/naughty.png" alt="The root user comic from XKCD"/>
    </div>

    <p> Superuser access is required to <em>install software</em> which is
        what we wanted to to, here. </p>

    <h4>apt-get install</h4>

    <p><code>apt-get</code> is the command line interface to the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool">advanced packaging tool</a>,
        which &mdash; and this is going to seem pretty magical if you're used to the way
        that Windows does things &mdash; allows you to install any Ubuntu program, automatically,
        with a single command.
    </p>

    <div class='left-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='left-aside aside'>
        <h4>Package Managers</h4>
        <p>
            Different Linuxes have different package managers. Ubuntu has <code>apt</code>,
            Red Hat has <code>yum</code>, Arch has <code>pacman</code>, Gentoo has <code>portage</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mac OS X doesn't have a package manager by default, but some enterprising hackers
            have stapled on <code>homebrew</code>, which is a <a href="https://www.slant.co/topics/523/~best-power-user-tools-for-macos">vital Mac tool</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Windows remains a featureless wasteland.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>Seriously. Want vim? Type <code>sudo apt-get install vim</code>. Want to install a program
        that pipes your command output through
        <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr>-art cows? <code>sudo apt-get install cowsay</code>.
        Want a steam locomotive? <code>sudo apt-get install sl</code>.</p>

    <div class='right-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='right-aside aside'>
        <h4>Cowsay-whaaat?</h4>
        <p>
            By default, if cowsay is installed, the <em>professional, enterprise-grade automation software</em>
            <strong>ansible</strong> will route all of its output through it.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is awesome.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h4>nginx</h4>

    <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx">Nginx</a> is a fast, lightweight HTTP server.
        It can also be configured to do a few other fun tricks, like act as a load balancer
        or reverse proxy, but right now we're interested in just using Nginx to serve some
        web page.
    </p>

    <h4>sudo apt-get install nginx</h4>

    <p> Well, that's enough explanation. Let's get to it! </p>

    <pre class='code'>
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:~$ sudo apt-get install nginx
    </pre>

    <p>
        This will ask us to confirm it by pressing <code>y</code>, then chug along
        and eventually stop chugging. At this point, we have a web server!
    </p>

    <h4> Prove it </h4>

    <p> Don't believe me? Open a browser and visit <code>localhost:8080</code> </p>

    <div class='figure'>
        <h3>Egads! It worked!</h3>
        <img src="images/chapter2/nginx.png" alt="A blank NGINX webpage" />
    </div>

    <h5>localhost</h5>
    <p>
        This is a shortcut! <code>localhost</code> is a domain that always
        resolves to <code>127.0.0.1</code>,
        which is a special IP address that always resolves to <strong>this computer, the
        one that I am using right now</strong>.
    </p>

    <h5>:8080</h5>
    <p>
        Earlier, I mentioned that the port that your browser connects to is always
        the default port for the protocol &mdash; in the case of HTTP, that's <code>80</code>.
        However, when we created the Virtual Machine, we specified that port 80 on the
        Virtual Machine should correspond with port 8080 on the host machine.
    </p>

    <p>
        When we enter a domain name, we can always add a colon and the port number to
        specify that we're connecting to a non-standard port.
    </p>

    <h3> Creating a Basic HTML Document </h3>

    <p>
        Now that we've got a server running an
        <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> server, we need something
        to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwtwb4g1qsk">serve</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        We're going to go into more detail about <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> later,
        but for now, let's create a very simple file, <code>index.html</code>
        and put it in our <code>~/code/hello_world/html</code>
        directory on our host computer
    </p>

    <div class='left-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='left-aside aside'>
        <h4>index.html</h4>
        <p>
            <code>index.html</code> is a special filename.
        </p>
        <p>
            Technically, when we navigate to a website, we are always
            supposed to indicate the file that we are asking for &mdash;
            our <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> should
            end with <code>/whatever.html</code> or <code>/anything.jpg</code>
            to indicate the file that we're looking for.
        </p>
        <p>
            By convention, however, many web servers are configured to look
            for <code>index.html</code> by default when no filename
            is specified. This is because, when we enter a directory,
            the index file would provide us a list of files in that directory.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, remember &mdash; the <code>index.html</code> file is what
            your web browser will serve if you don't request a specific file.
        </p>
    </div>

    <pre>
    <code class='html'>
&lt;!-- I go in ~/code/hello_world/html/index.html --&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;hello, world&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;hello, world&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        This file should now exist at <code>/home/ubuntu/html/index.html</code> on
        our virtual machine.
    </p>

    <h3> Serving our HTML </h3>

    <p>
        By default, nginx serves the contents of a system directory, <code>/var/www/html</code>,
        which contains the "hey, you're running nginx" message we saw earlier.
    </p>

    <p>
        We could just copy our file into <code>/var/www/html</code>, but that's not the
        satisfying solution that we want. No, we want to tell nginx to serve
        from <code>/home/ubuntu/html</code> rather than <code>/var/www/html</code>
        by changing nginx's configuration files!
    </p>

    <p>
        One problem: nginx's configuration files are deep within the Ubuntu virtual machine,
        not synced to anywhere on our host machine. We have to edit these configuration
        files from <em>within the virtual machine</em>.
    </p>

    <h3> A Different Kind of Text Editor </h3>

    <p>
        Presumably, we're far enough along in the craft of programming to know that a
        text editor is the software developer's multi-tool, and one's choice of text editor
        is approximately as emotionally charged and contentious as one's choice of video
        game console.
    </p>
    <div class='left-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='left-aside small-aside aside'>
        <p>
            TurboGrafx 16 forever!
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        But there's a problem &mdash; because we're working extensively with <abbr title="Secure Shell">SSH</abbr>,
        and <abbr title="Secure Shell">SSH</abbr> is a command shell, with no mouse to speak of, we're going to need
        a text editor that operates entirely from within the shell.
    </p>

    <p>
        This leaves us, then, with about three different options:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>vim</strong>, my favourite, which is cryptic and difficult, but powerful</li>
            <li><strong>emacs</strong>, which is even more cryptic and difficult, but even more powerful</li>
            <li><strong>nano</strong>, which is quite easy to learn, but offers limited functionality</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <div class='figure'>
        <h4>Nano is Like a Spork</h4>
        <img src='images/chapter2/198.png' alt="a comic that makes fun of nano users" />
    </div>

    <p>
        As much as I want to push my pigheaded <strong>vim</strong> lust on to a new generation
        of developers, nano is the easiest editor to get started with.
    </p>

    <div class='left-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='left-aside small-aside aside'>
        <p>
            <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/05/23/stack-overflow-helping-one-million-developers-exit-vim/">"I've been programming in vim for 10 years. I don't like it, I just
            can't figure out how to quit."</a>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class='right-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='right-aside aside'>
        <h3>Making nano suck less</h3>
        <p>
            Part of the trouble with nano is that, by default,
            it has very limited undo support and it doesn't
            highlight code.
        </p>
        <p>
            While this is an excuse by many to embrace a more powerful editor,
            nano is quite capable of doing these things
            with <a href="https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/v2.1/nanorc.5.html">a little bit of configuration</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Making nano better is just a pebble in your eventual path
            to the boulder that is learning Vim, though.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Configuring Nginx</h3>

    <pre class='code'>
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:~$ sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
    </pre>

    <h4>sudo again</h4>
    <p>
        Why <code>sudo</code>? Well, <code>/etc/nginx/sites-available/default</code> is a
        system file, and we wouldn't normally have access to modify it.
    </p>

    <h4>/etc is for config</h4>
    <p>
        <code>/etc</code> is the directory that contains the configuration files
        for most Linux systems. <strong>This is not a very good name</strong>.
        They might as well have called this directory <code>/you/know/whatever</code>
        or <code>/idfk</code> &mdash; or maybe, and I'm just spit-balling, here, <code>/config</code>,
        but the insane tradition of calling this directory <code>/etc</code> lives on.
    </p>

    <h4>/sites-available/default</h4>
    <p>
        While the core configuration for nginx lives at <code>/etc/nginx/nginx.conf</code>,
        all it does is reference a bunch of other files.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometimes I like to throw out all of the default configuration and just dump all
        of my configuration directly into <code>nginx.conf</code>, but for this example
        we're going to play ball with the rules and instead edit this
        other configuration file.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here's the configuration file:
    </p>

    <div class='hang-right-aside-arrow long-arrow' style="margin-top: 745px;"></div>
    <div class='hang-right-aside aside' style="margin-top: 700px;">
        <h4>Here!</h4>
        <p>
            Here's the line we want to change.
        </p>
        <p>
            We want this to read <code>root /home/ubuntu/html;</code>
        </p>
    </div>
    <pre>

        This is an awful lot of file to look at, but there's only one line that we're concerned about.
        We need to change <code>root /var/www/html;</code> to read <code>root /home/ubuntu/html;</code>,
        and then save the file.

            Here, we are making <code>/home/ubuntu/html</code> our
            <strong>web root</strong> and serving everything in
            that entire folder.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h4>Rebooting nginx</h4>

    <p>
        That change should do it, but none of our configuration changes will take effect
        until we <em>reboot nginx</em>.

        <p>
            Environment setup is a really important part of web development.

    <h3> Cleaning Up &amp; Starting Over </h3>

    <p>
        We're done, but our Virtual Machine is still running. It'll keep on running, forever.
        That's the whole point of a server.
    </p>

    <p>
        We can quit the terminal.
    </p>

    <pre class='code'>
ubuntu@ubuntu-xenial:~$ exit

<span class='machine'>curtis@SMOKESTACK</span> <span class='path'>~/code/hello_world</span>
<span class='prompt'>$</span>
    </pre>

    <p>
        But if we check <code>localhost:8080</code>, the server's still running.
    </p>

    <p>
        The only way to truly kill the server is to <del>plunge a stake through it's heart</del>
        turn it off, which we can do with <code>vagrant halt</code>.
    </p>

    <pre class='code'>
<span class='machine'>curtis@SMOKESTACK</span> <span class='path'>~/code/hello_world</span>
<span class='prompt'>$</span> vagrant halt
==&gt; default: Attempting graceful shutdown of VM...
    </pre>

    <p>
        That killed it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's imagine, though, that we made a serious mistake. While we were working
        on the operating system we accidentally made a change that ruined everything
        forever and we don't know how to fix it.

    </div>

    <p>
        We want to go back to a completely
        clean slate, to the good times before we had a Virtual Machine at all.
        This is the situation where <code>vagrant destroy</code> is here to purify
        our hard drive with its scouring light.

    <p>
        Never again will you trouble our shores with your foul presence, <em>Virtual Machine</em>.

    <p>
        We can always bring it back with <code>vagrant up</code> when we need it again.

    <h3> Chapter 2 Summary </h3>

    <p>
        We've done a lot, to get our web server up and running and serving "hello, world"!
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            We installed a <strong>command line interface</strong> and
            learned some basics about how to use it.
        </li>
        <li>
            We used <strong>Vagrant and VirtualBox</strong> to install an
            <strong>Ubuntu Linux Virtual Machine</strong> on our computer.
        </li>
        <li>
            We used <strong>sudo</strong> and <strong>apt-get</strong> to
            install <strong>nginx</strong> on our server.
        </li>
        <li>
            We created a basic <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> file.
        </li>
        <li>
            We used <strong>nano</strong> to change nginx's configuration.

        <li>
            We <strong>rebooted nginx</strong>.

    <h2> Chapter 3: HyperText</h2>

    <p>
        We've talked about <strong>HyperText Transfer Protocol</strong> and <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>,
        so what in the blue blazes is <strong>HyperText</strong>?
    </p>

    <div class='left-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='left-aside aside'>
        <h4>Garden of Forking Paths</h4>
        <p>
            In 1945, Vannevar Bush described a hypothetical device called the <em>memex</em> which allowed
            its users to organize content in a way that allowed for it to be indexed, searched,
            and linked to other content.
        </p>
        <p>
            While a memex, as described, was never built, the concept of a network of interlinked documents
            captured the public imagination.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the 1960's, Ted Nelson popularized the term "Hypertext" for the same concept. Engineers
            spent the next 30 years working on various implementations until Tim Berners-Lee finally
            produced a popular implementation in 1989.
        </p>
        <h4>Tim Berners-Lee</h4>
        <p>
            The clever dude who figured this out was Tim Berners-Lee, who was looking for a way to
            take the peanut butter of 'hypertext' and the chocolate of 'a world-wide network of computers'
            and mash them together.
        </p>
        <p>
            He developed HTTP, HTML, and the URL,
            technologies that worked in concert to produce a world-spanning network of interlinked content
            that he called the "WorldWideWeb".
        </p>

        <p>That means that when he lists his job title as
            <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bp2GVC2CQAAH4uN.jpg">"Web Developer"</a>,
            this is both <em>literally true</em> and
            a wonderful example of subtle understatement.</p>
    </div>

    <p>
        As with most things, there's a lot of history and nuance behind the term, and <em>also</em>
        as with most things, the way that most people understand the term completely discards all
        of that history and nuance: <strong>HyperText</strong> is text with a bunch of extra stuff
        strapped on, <em>links</em> and <em>images</em> and <em>style</em> and <em>fonts</em> and
        <em>videos of cats</em> and <em>scripts</em>.
    </p>


    <div class='right-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='right-aside aside'>
        <h4>Hypermedia</h4>
        <p>
            Some will complain that the term "hypertext" only refers to "text with links", and
            the proper term for text with all of the images and videos is <strong>hypermedia</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            But it's not <em>hypermedia markup language</em>, is it?
        </p>
        <p>
            You can safely sock these people away with the people who insist on saying URI.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Links and URLs</h3>
    <p>
        There are two big questions of hypertext
        <ul>
            <li>How do we represent a link to another document in a document? </li>
            <li>How do we represent a diverse array of multimedia content in a simple file format? </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        The answer to both of these questions is the humble
        <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>. A
        <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> can represent a link to any sort
        of content.
    </p>

    <div class='left-aside-arrow'> </div>

    <p>
        So <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> documents are littered with
        <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>s,
        both as links to other documents and as a means to embed multimedia
        content in a wide variety of formats.
    </p>

    <h3> Text Files and Markup Language </h3>
    <p>
        Under the hood, all file formats are just binary narrowly disguised as something else.
    </p>

    <p>
        When we think of file formats for text, our first thought might be of Word, from Microsoft Office &mdash;
        a format that also contains information about how to properly render the document, fonts, document layout
        details, and much much more. Unfortunately, Word file formats &mdash; of which there
        are several at this point &mdash; are legendary tarpits of horrendous complexity, closed off so that
        they can only be understood by Microsoft engineers, a hideous conglomeration of text and binary
        that make Word the file format equivalent of the last 15 minutes of Akira.
    </p>

    <div class='figure'>
        <img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/82/57/b7/8257b7daf904eb51444a13cdff6b5655.gif" src="the scene in Akira where a goon is trapped in bio-sludge"/>
        <p> Pictured: An OpenOffice developer trying to make sense of Word's file format. </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        A common way to manage the complexity associated with complicated documents are to represent them
        as simple plain-text files. It's not quite as simple and efficient as storing documents
        in pure binary representations, but the file formats end up being human-readable by anybody with a text editor,
        which is great for the clarity and interoperability of the format.
    </p>

    <pre>
But the problem of plaintext becomes quickly clear:
it doesn't support presentational elements very well.
How do you include a list of items? A table? An image?
How do you define font sizes and margin widths?
There need to be rules that a computer can follow
to take a plaintext file and turn it into
a proper document.

Furthermore, we shouldn't show these rules to
the user.

A <strong>markup language</strong> allows us to mark
the text with additional information that isn't shown
to the user, but indicates additional information
like <em>emphasis</em>, <span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>color</span>, and <span style='font-family:chunk'>font</strong>.
    </pre>

    <p>or, to look at that last line, again, in Hypertext Markup Language: </p>

    <pre>
A &lt;strong&gt;markup language&lt;/strong&gt; allows us to mark
the text with additional information that isn't shown
to the user, but indicates additional information
like &lt;em&gt;emphasis&lt;/em&gt;,
&lt;span style='color:red;'&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;, and
&lt;span style='font-family:chunk'&gt;font&lt;/strong&gt;.
    </pre>

    <p>
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> &mdash; Hypertext Markup Language &mdash;
        is not the only markup language
        &mdash; many of them exist.
    </p>

    <p>
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is based on a language called
        <abbr title="Standard Generalized Markup Language">SGML</abbr>,
        which was based on a language called
        <abbr title="Generalized Markup Language">GML</abbr>,
        which was created at
        <abbr title="International Business Machines">IBM</abbr>
        in the 1970 as a documentation language.
    </p>

    <p>
        Technically, <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> qualified as a
        subclass of <abbr title="Standard Generalized Markup Language">SGML</abbr>
        until the introduction of
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language version 5">HTML5</abbr>,
        which finally cut all remaining ties with the old standard.
    </p>

    <h4>Some Other Markup Languages</h4>

    <p>
        Another child of <abbr title="Standard Generalized Markup Language">SGML</abbr>
        is <abbr title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>. While
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> was intended to be a
        representation of documents and the sort of data that would commonly
        appear in documents &mdash; tables, images and such &mdash;
        <abbr title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> is a similar format
        that was designed as a general-purpose
        markup language for <em>any</em> kind of data.
    </p>

    <p>Some <abbr title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> might look like this: </p>

    <pre>
    <code class='xml'>
&lt;employee&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;Barry Fudgechampion&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;age&gt;27&lt;/age&gt;
    &lt;salary&gt;Low&lt;/salary&gt;
    &lt;odor&gt;Potent&lt;/odor&gt;
&lt;/employee&gt;

    <div class='right-aside aside'>
        <h3>Documents vs. Data</h3>
        <p>
            One potential point of confusion with markup languages
            is that some of them, like
            <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
            and
            <strong>Markdown</strong>,
            are intended to represent documents
            &mdash; like recipes, or textbooks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some other markup languages, like
            <abbr title="Javascript Object Notation">JSON</abbr>
            or
            <abbr title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>,
            are intended to
            represent <em>arbitrary</em> data, which might be "employees"
            or "products in a catalogue" or "geographical data".
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        <strong>Markdown</strong> is a markup language that's designed to be interoperable
        with <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and easy for humans to read and edit,
        even when it's just plain text.

    <p>Some Markdown might look like this: </p>

# Laziness, Impatience, and Hubris

    "We will encourage you to develop the three great virtues of a programmer:
    laziness, impatience, and hubris." -- Larry Wall, Programming Perl (1st edition)

Take a look at [this link](http://wiki.c2.com/?LazinessImpatienceHubris)
for more information.

## Laziness

The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure.
It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful,
and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about it.
Hence, the first great virtue of a programmer.
Also hence, this book. See also _impatience and hubris_.

## Impatience

The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy.
This makes you write programs that don't just react to your needs,
but actually anticipate them.
Or at least pretend to. Hence, the second great virtue of a programmer.
See also _laziness and hubris_.

## Hubris

Excessive pride, the sort of thing Zeus zaps you for.
Also the quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won't
want to say bad things about. Hence, the third great virtue of a programmer.
See also _laziness and impatience_.

        <abbr title="Javascript Object Notation">JSON</abbr> (Javascript Object Notation)

        <abbr title="Yet Another Markup Language">YAML</abbr> (Yet Another Markup Language)
        is a markup language that's
        designed to be easy for humans to read and edit, designed to represent
        complex objects.
    </p>

    <p>Some <abbr title="Yet Another Markup Language">YAML</abbr> might look like this: </p>

     So he carefully spat on the ceiling

    </pre>

    <p>
        Some of these markup languages are easier for humans to read. Some of them are easier
        to code with. Some of them are more stict and some of them are less strict.
        Some of them are intended to represent data and some of them are intended to represent documents.
        But they are all <em>a way to use plain text to represent something more complicated than plain text</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
        All of these different markup langauges are good for different purposes.

                <li>
                    <strong>Markdown</strong> is good for human-written multimedia documents
                    that are still readable in their text format.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <abbr title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> is good for representing
                    objects that have a strictly defined format.
                </li>
            </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Bad news: You're probably going to have to learn <em>all of these markup languages</em>
        at one point or another.
    </p>

    <p> Good news: They're not very difficult to learn! </p>

    <h3> Character Encoding </h3>

    <p>
        It's possible, through the use of these different markup languages, to represent just about anything
        as a plain-text file.
    </p>
    <div class='right-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='right-aside small-aside aside'>
        <p>
            SVG graphics, for example, are defined by an
            <abbr title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>
            file filled with vector graphics information.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        "A text file" is a little bit disingenuous, though. There's no such thing as just a "text file".
        A text file is, under the hood, a series of characters represented as binary data.
    </p>

    <p> How, then, do we represent a text file as binary data? </p>

    <p>
        There are numerous schemes for converting character data into binary data, and these schemes are
        known as character encodings.
    </p>

    <h4>ASCII</h4>

    <p>
        An early common character encoding is
        <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> &mdash;
        which is simple &mdash; 7 bits can make 128 different combinations.
        That's more than enough room for all 26 latin alphabet characters in both lowercase and uppercase,
        <em>and</em> all of the numbers and symbols on a standard
        <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> keyboard, with room left over
        for some control codes like "new line", "tab", "alert", and "bell".
    </p>

    <div class='figure'>

    <p>
        <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr>
        was enormously popular for a very long time &mdash; but the big problem with
        <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr>
        is that 128 characters are not enough characters to encompass the entire character
        set of all available human languages.

    <h4> ISO-8859 </h4>

    <p> 7 bits is all well and good, but 8 bits would double the amount of character space
        available to us &mdash; and 8 bits makes a byte, which makes it really easy
        to remember "A character is about a byte".</p>

    <p> What characters do we cram into that extra 128 spaces on the table, though?
        Even English contains a bunch of words that use
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_terms_with_diacritical_marks">diacritical marks</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        How do we decide whether to include the spanish ñ, so that we can say "jalapeño"
        or the french ç, so that we can say "soupçon" and "façade"?
    </p>

    <p>
        And what about characters that are used extensively by unimportant languages
        like <em>every other human language?</em>
    </p>

            "And this is my universal translator. Unfortunately, so far, it only
            translates into an incomprehensible dead language."</a>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        One idea was to use <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> for the first 128 characters, and then, in the other
        128 characters, fit all of the extra bits required for groups of different languages.
        Group 1 would contain a bunch of characters for latin-based languages like
        English, French, German, Italian, Portugese. Group 2 would have characters
        useful for central european languages like Polish, Czech, and Hungarian.
        This scheme would be extensible, allowing new groups to be added &mdash;
        and, to date, there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859">sixteen</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        This scheme was called
        <abbr title="International Standards Organization, Standard 8859 - 8-bit Single-byte Coded Graphic Character Sets">ISO-8859</abbr>,
        and it enjoyed common usage
        through most of the 90s and 00s, and group 1,
        <abbr title="International Standards Organization, Standard 8859 - 8-bit Single-byte Coded Graphic Character Sets - Part 1: Latin Alphabet No. 1">ISO-8859-1</abbr>, commonly
        known as <strong>latin-1</strong>, became one of the world's most common
        character encodings.
    </p>

    <p> Here's <code>ñello, world</code> in latin-1: </p>

    <pre>
11110001 &nbsp; ñ
01100101 &nbsp; e
01101100 &nbsp; l
01101100 &nbsp; l
01101111 &nbsp; o
00101100 &nbsp; ,
00100000 &nbsp;
01110111 &nbsp; w
01101111 &nbsp; o
01110010 &nbsp; r
01101100 &nbsp; l
01100100 &nbsp; d
    </pre>

    <p> The only character that stands out is ñ, which lives in the last-half of the encoding,
        so it starts with a one. All of the other characters are the equivalent to their
        <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr>-encodings.</p>

            Also note that "ñello" would be pronounced "nyello", which is a very
            satisfying way to say the word.

    <h4> &#xfffd; &#xfffd; &#xfffd; &#xfffd; what even </h4>

    <p>
        When downloading a <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> file from
        the internet using <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr>, the
        <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> server
        is <em>supposed</em> to accurately report the character encoding
        that the text is using.
    </p>

    <p> Sometimes, though, the
        <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr>
        server sends the wrong character encoding.
        Stupid
        <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> server.
        When most browsers can't understand a character,
        they'll display the &#xfffd; character,
        which is the browser equivalent of going &#xAF;\_(&#x30C4;)_/&#xAF;.
    </p>

    <p>
        It's getting harder and harder to find webpages with serious encoding errors
        but fortunately Eric S. Raymond hasn't updated his Jargon File in a long while,
        <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/A/all-your-base-are-belong-to-us.html">so we can still find some</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        There's a bug that used to be common &mdash; Windows used an encoding in the
        Windows-98 era, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252">Windows 1252</a>
        that was commonly confused for latin-1.
    </p>
    <p>
        Webpages would report that they were returning latin-1 when they were actually returning
        windows-1252, and the result would be web-pages lined with the &#xfffd; character.
        It doesn't happen much any more, because the world has been standardizing on
        a new encoding: <abbr title="Unicode Transformation Format - 8 Bit">UTF-8</abbr>.
    </p>

    <p> But before we get to <abbr title="Unicode Transformation Format - 8 Bit">UTF-8</abbr> we have to talk about <strong>Unicode</strong>.</p>

    <h4>Unicode</h4>
    <p>
        The problem with all of these character schemes is that they have to be <em>efficient</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nobody is interested in a character encoding scheme that has room for all of the
        different possible characters, because it's just not practical for every single
        character to take several bytes of space to represent.
    </p>

    <p>
        Character encoding is <em>hard</em>, though. For one thing, there's a lot of characters
        that are <a href="https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~ggbaker/reference/characters/">very easy to confuse
        for one another.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        "Do you know what would be nice", I imagine someone saying. "It would be nice if we
        just had a list of every single character and gave each one of them a number."
    </p>

    <p>
        "That's not a character encoding scheme", said someone else in this hypothetical scenario.
        "There's not even any instructions for how to convert that into a binary representation,
        that's just a big list of all of the possible characters, and each of them have a unique
        number."
    </p>

    <p>
        "It doesn't need to be a <em>whole character encoding scheme</em>. It'd just be <em>nice</em> if we had a unique
        number for each character."
    </p>

    <p>
        So, that's what <strong>Unicode</strong> is &mdash; not a binary encoding scheme at all, really,
        just a list of all of the characters and a unique number for each of them.
        This unique number is called a <strong>code point</strong>.

        <h3> Emoji Are Just Unicode </h3>
        <p>
            Most emoji transmitted by our phones are just <a href="http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html">unicode characters</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The emoji are translated into graphics in the same way that
            characters are translated into fonts, which is why
            we can send a &#x1F601; "smiley face" symbol from an Apple phone
            to an Android phone and &mdash; while they may render the symbol differently
            &mdash; they both still mean "smiley face".

    <p> The <a href="https://unicode-table.com/en/">entire Unicode character table</a> is
        enormous. "A" is 41, "&#194;" is 194, "&#3061;" is 3061. "&#9822;" is 9822. There's space
        for everything, including every character in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean,
        and there are over 120,000 characters in the complete table. </p>

        <h3>He Comes</h3>
        <p>
            Unicode contains characters that modify previous characters and characters
            to change how other characters are displayed, which enabled the coming of
            the dark lord
            Z&#x365;&#x338;&#x333;&#x32F;&#x320;&#x331;&#x33C;a&#x300;&#x367;&#x34C;&#x31C;l&#x340;&#x319;&#x356;&#x34E;&#x318;&#x347;&#x34E;&#x32F;g&#x310;&#x36D;&#x34A;&#x302;&#x489;&#x348;&#x329;&#x359;&#x31E;&#x32E;o&#x30E;&#x36C;&#x305;&#x34C;&#x36E;&#x31D;&#x32E;.
        </p>
    </div>


    <h4> Unicode is not a Binary Encoding Scheme</h4>

    <p>
        Because Unicode is not itself a binary encoding scheme, just a list of characters,
        that brings the obvious follow-up question: how do we represent Unicode in binary, then?
    </p>

    <p>
        And the answer: there are lots of different schemes!
        <abbr title="2-Byte Universal Character Set">UCS-2</abbr>,
        <abbr title="Unicode Transformation Format - 32 Bit">UTF-32</abbr>,
        <abbr title="Unicode Transformation Format - 16 Bit">UTF-16</abbr>,
        <abbr title="Unicode Transformation Format - Stream">UTF-1</abbr>,
        <abbr title="Unicode Transformation Format - 8 Bit">UTF-8</abbr>,
        <abbr title="Unicode Transformation Format - 7 Bit">UTF-7</abbr>,
        <abbr title="Unicode Transformation Format - Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code">UTF-EBCDIC</abbr>, there are many, many standards
        for representing Unicode characters in binary, most of them with various clever tricks
        to keep their size under control.
    </p>

    <p>
        It's hard, especially because Unicode is an <em>giant, unbounded table</em>. New characters
        are being added to Unicode all the time.

        <h3> Taco Symbol </h3>

            Code point 127,790 has been set aside
            <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/17/8799255/taco-emoji-its-really-happening">for the Taco symbol</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, support for the taco symbol is still limited,
            and most browsers and phones won't display it, yet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here, let's give it a try: &#127790;

        <p>
            Dang. That's the "I don't have a font for that character" symbol.

    </div>

    <p>
        If we're not interested in efficiency at all, we can just set aside 32 bits for
        <em>each character</em>. So long as Unicode stays less than 4 billion characters, this
        should work fine. This is known as
        <abbr title="Unicode Transformation Format - 32 Bit">UTF-32</abbr>
        , and it's
        very simple and easy to understand. It also wastes a <em>lot</em> of space.
        If
        <abbr title="Unicode Transformation Format - 32 Bit">UTF-32</abbr>
        were common, it would quadruple the size of most web requests.

        <h3>Awesome Code Points</h3>

            Some internet folk have been collecting
            <a href="https://github.com/Codepoints/awesome-codepoints">Awesome Codepoints</a>.
            Just in case we need some.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h4>Just Use UTF-8</h4>
    <p>
        The sneaky trick is that, as much as we sometimes need special characters,
        most of our day-to-day communication and code come out of the 128 characters
        that we originally used for
        <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr>.
    </p>

    <p>
        <abbr title="Unicode Transformation Format - 8 Bit">UTF-8</abbr>
        is a scheme that uses 8-bytes for <em>most</em> characters,
        but uses extra bytes when necessary to encode special characters.
    </p>

    <p>
        This means that
        <abbr title="Unicode Transformation Format - 8 Bit">UTF-8</abbr>
        is as efficient as <em>latin-1</em> most of the
        time, while <em>also</em> being able to represent the entirety of Unicode.

        <h3>Mozilla Will Help</h3>
        <p>
            I'm trying my best, here, but Mozilla's
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML">Introduction to HTML</a>
            is much more comprehensive than mine.
        </p>
    </div>


    <p>
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
        has many versions at this point &mdash;
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language Version 5">HTML5</abbr>,
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language Version 4">HTML 4.1</abbr>,
        <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language Version 2">XHTML 2.0</abbr> &mdash;
        and in order for the browser to render the
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> properly, it needs to know which
        version of <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> it is looking at.
    </p>

    <p>
        Until <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language Version 5">HTML5</abbr>,
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> was technically a
        subset of a language called <abbr title="Standard Generalized Markup Language">SGML</abbr>, and
        <abbr title="Standard Generalized Markup Language">SGML</abbr>
        required that documents come with a "Document Type Definition" which would lay
        out all of the rules for displaying the document. Any
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> document released before
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language Version 5">HTML5</abbr>,
        then, would have a doctype that looks like:
    </p>

    <pre>
    <code class='html'>
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"&gt;
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        When <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language Version 5">HTML5</abbr> dropped
        <abbr title="Standard Generalized Markup Language">SGML</abbr> compatibility,
        it was also decided that the doctype wouldn't need
        a link to a document type definition any longer. Now it's just <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>.
        All <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language Version 5">HTML5</abbr>
        documents start this way, to let browsers know that this is an
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language Version 5">HTML5</abbr> document.
    </p>

    <h4> HTML Element </h4>

    <p>
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is strictly heirarchical,
        which means that every element in the document
        must be enclosed by another element, except for the "root" element which
        wraps everything in the entire document. This is the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element,
        the outermost element that contains everything else.
    </p>

    <p>
    <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> elements usually start with an
        opening tag and end with a closing tag &mdash;
        in this case, <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> is the opening tag and
        <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code> is the closing tag. Everything inside the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag
        is considered to be inside the document. Everything outside the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag
        is ... outside the document?
    </p>

    <h4> Attributes </h4>

    <pre>
    <code class='html'>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
        elements can also have <strong>attributes</strong>, which are attached to the
        opening tag and look like <code>attribute="value"</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this case, we've attached the <code>lang="en"</code> attribute to the base HTML
        element to let the world know that this HTML document is in English.
    </p>

    <h4> HTML Comments </h4>
    <pre>
    <code class="html">
&lt;!-- Nobody can see this, no matter where you put it in the HTML --&gt;

&lt;!-- Comments are important in any language, even HTML --&gt;

&lt;!--
Comments
can
span
multiple
lines
--&gt;

&lt;!-- Sometimes you want to say stuff that nobody can see in the final page output. --&gt;

&lt;!-- Watch out, though - people can still see the comments in your HTML source. --&gt;
    </code>
    </pre>

    <h4> Head &amp; Body </h4>

    <pre>
    <code class='html'>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        Inside the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> element comes two key elements that divide the document into
        "the part you see" (the <strong>body</strong>) and "the part you don't see" (the <strong>head</strong>).
    </p>

    <p>
        The head element is loaded before the rest of the page. It contains metadata
        about the content in the body like the document's title, as well as any
        style information that the page needs to load.
    </p>

    <h4>Elements What Go In The Head</h4>

    <p>
        The elements that go in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element are
        important metadata about the page.
    </p>

    <p>
        It's <em>possible</em> to completely skip the <code>head</code> and go right on
        to the <code>body</code>.
    </p>

    <div class='right-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='right-aside aside'>
        <img src="images/chapter3/seduction.jpg" alt="a famous 'seduction' picture from Seinfeld">
        <p>
            This is also possible in <em>lovemaking</em>. And just as inadvisable.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        We shouldn't, though &mdash; a lot of stuff in the <code>head</code> is
        important to the proper operation of the page.
    </p>

    <h5>Charset</h5>

    <pre>
    <code class='html'>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        This next part we've added, <code>&lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;/&gt;</code>,
        defines the character encoding of the document as
        <abbr title="Unicode Transformation Format - 8 Byte">UTF-8</abbr>.
    </p>

    <div class='left-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='left-aside aside'>
        <h3>Crazy Like a Fox</h3>
        <p>
            Yeah, that whole entire segment on character encoding? That was just
            so that we'd understand this bit right here.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        The <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> server that serves this document reads this when it serves the document
        and uses it to accurately report what binary encoding scheme this document is
        using.
    </p>

    <div class='right-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='right-aside aside'>
        <p>
            Oh, if we're reporting that this file is in
            <abbr title="Unicode Transformation Format - 8 Byte">UTF-8</abbr>
            we should make sure
            that we've actually saved the file using the
            <abbr title="Unicode Transformation Format - 8 Byte">UTF-8</abbr>
            charset.
        </p>
        <p>
            The process for doing this is
            <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21289157/set-encoding-of-file-to-utf8-with-bom-in-sublime-text-3">different from text editor to text editor</a>.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        The <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag is a special tag that doesn't wrap any content, so it
        <em>doesn't require a closing tag.</em>
    </p>

    <h5>Title</h5>

    <pre>
    <code class='html'>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Definitely Wikipedia&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>
    </pre>

    <p>
    The <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element contains the title of the document.
    In this case, it is <strong>Definitely Wikipedia</strong>.
    </p>

    <div class='figure'>
        <img src='images/chapter3/title.png'>
        <p>
            Hey, it's a thing that we can see! Look at that sweet title.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h5>Author &amp; Description</h5>

    <pre>
    <code class='html'>
&lt;meta name="description" content="This is a description of the content on the page" /&gt;
&lt;meta name="author" content="Andrea Authorface" /&gt;
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        The <code>description</code> meta tag is picked up by Google and Twitter when we share a link
        to our html page somewhere.
    </p>

    <div class='figure'>
        <img src='images/chapter3/description.png'>
        <p>
            The content of the <code>description</code> meta tag shows up here.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Best I can tell, the <code>author</code> meta tag isn't used anywhere and is completely optional.
    </p>

    <h5>Favicon</h5>

    <p>
        This is one of my favourite <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tricks!
    </p>

    <div class='figure'>
        <p>Let's take a look at my browser's tabs.</p>
        <img src='images/chapter3/favicon_row.png'>

        <p>It almost seems like the icon is more important than the title, for most of these!</p>

        <p>Also, and this is a fun thing to note, the Google Calendar favicon is
            <em>accurate to the day that I'm looking at it</em> which is a very
            cool touch. </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        These icons are called "favicons".
    </p>

    <div class='left-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='left-aside aside'>
        <p>
            In the 1986 classic "Transformers: The Movie", the Autobots
            fight the Favicons for dominance over Cybertron.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        It's possible to link a favicon to our page by including a link
        to a very small image file.
    </p>

    <div class='right-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='right-aside aside'>
        <p>
            The favicon can be an <code>.ico</code>, a <code>.png</code>,
            a <code>.gif</code>, even a <code>.jpg</code> if you're feeling
            sassy.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the nice things about the <code>.ico</code> format is that
            it is possible to generate an icon file that contains different
            versions of the icon in <code>16x16</code>,
            <code>32x32</code>, <code>64x64</code>, and <code>128x128</code> sizes,
            so that browsers have the option to display the icon at varying
            scales without horrifying scaling artifacts.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's possible, using the <code>.gif</code> format, to have an
            animated favicon, but please don't.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>A basic favicon link looks like this: </p>
    <pre>
    <code class='html'>
&lt;link rel="shortcut icon" href="http://buildatheweb.com/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon"&gt;
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        The <code>type</code> option here needs to match the type of the file that we're
        linking to. In the case of an <code>.ico</code> file, it's <code>image/x-icon</code>,
        but if we were to provide a <code>.png</code> file, it would be
        <code>image/png</code>. This format is a standard called
        <abbr title="Multimedia Internet Mail Extensions - Type">MIME Type</abbr>, and a list
        of file-extension to
        <abbr title="Multimedia Internet Mail Extensions - Type">MIME Type</abbr> mappings
        can be found
        <a href='https://www.sitepoint.com/web-foundations/mime-types-complete-list/'>here</a>.
    </p>

    <div class='left-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='left-aside aside'>
        <p>
            <abbr title="Multimedia Internet Mail Extensions - Type">MIME Types</abbr>
            appear pretty often.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite being ostensibly for "Multimedia Internet Mail", the standard
            is used extensively within
            <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> to describe the type
            of files that are being passed around and linked to.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you look back at our sample
            <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> response
            from the server in Chapter 1, it included the header
            <code>Content-type: text/html</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>Content-type</code> in
            <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr>
            uses <abbr title="Multimedia Internet Mail Extensions - Type">MIME Types</abbr>,
            and <code>text/html</code> is the type for
            <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p> It's possible to really go to town optimizing our favicons &mdash; providing different
        icon sizes and formats for every device that could possibly display our webpage,
        but just a <code>32x32</code> <code>.png</code> file should be a serviceable option.
    </p>

    <h5>Style &amp; Scripts</h5>

    <p>
        We're not going to talk about these yet! Wait until we get to our chapters on
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
        and JavaScript respectively.
    </p>

    <h4>Body Elements</h4>

    <p>
        All of the parts of the document we've built so far? They're hiding just under the surface
        of our document. Now we look at the exciting parts that people can actually see!
    </p>

    <h5>Paragraphs</h5>
    <p>
        Let's start by just dropping a bunch of Charles Stross quotes in the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>:
    </p>

    <pre>
    <code class='html'>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Definitely Wikipedia&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;meta name="description" content="This is a description of the content on the page" /&gt;
        &lt;meta name="author" content="Andrea Authorface" /&gt;
        &lt;link rel="shortcut icon" href="http://buildatheweb.com/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon"&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
Like the famous mad philosopher said, when you stare into the void, the void stares also;
but if you cast into the void, you get a type conversion error.
(Which just goes to show Nietzsche wasn't a C++ programmer.)

Helpfiles are traditionally outnumbered by no-help files, which superficially resemble a helpfile
in form but not in content because they don't actually tell you anything you don't already know,
or they answer every question except the one you're asking, or you open them and a giant
animated paper clip leaps out and cheerfully asks where you want to go today. And wikis are worse.
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        When we open this <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> file in a
        browser, we get something that looks like this:
    </p>

    <iframe src='ex3.html'></iframe>

    <p>
        We wanted those paragraphs to be separate! The
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
        just up and ignored our helpful spacing in the HTML file.
    </p>

    <div class='hang-right-aside-arrow short-arrow' style='margin-top:20px'> </div>
    <div class='hang-right-aside aside' style='margin-top:-25px'>
        <p>
            This is a paragraph!
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        What we need is to indicate that those words are in separate paragraphs.
        We can do this with the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag.
    </p>

    <pre>
    <code class='html'>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Definitely Wikipedia&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;meta name="description" content="This is a description of the content on the page" /&gt;
        &lt;meta name="author" content="Andrea Authorface" /&gt;
        &lt;link rel="shortcut icon" href="http://buildatheweb.com/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon"&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Like the famous mad philosopher said, when you stare into the void, the void stares also;
            but if you cast into the void, you get a type conversion error.
            (Which just goes to show Nietzsche wasn't a C++ programmer.)

    <p>There we go. </p>

    <h5>Is The Indentation Really Necessary?</h5>

    <p>As we discovered just now, the whitespace in our HTML file doesn't matter. </p>

    <p>So the indentation is just there to make the source code easier to read &mdash;
        it doesn't have any effect on the rendering of the page.</p>

    <div class='hang-left-aside-arrow tiny-arrow' style='margin-top:60px;width:5px;'> </div>
    <div class='hang-left-aside aside' style='margin-top:20px'>
        <p>
            This is a header!
        </p>
    </div>

    <h5>Headers </h5>

    <p>
        You've been reading this document (presumably), so you've noticed that
        it's divided into segments, by <strong>Headers</strong>, like the one
        that says "Headers" that I used to open this segment.
    </p>

    <p>
        Headers come in six different "levels", from
        <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>
        all the way up to
        <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Conventionally,
        <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>,
        the largest header, is used for the document's title.
        <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> is used for headings,
        <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> for sub-headings, and so on,
        through the document.
    </p>

    <pre>
    <code class='html'>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Definitely Wikipedia&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;meta name="description" content="This is a description of the content on the page" /&gt;
        &lt;meta name="author" content="Andrea Authorface" /&gt;
        &lt;link rel="shortcut icon" href="http://buildatheweb.com/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon"&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Header Level One&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            There is a philosophy by which many people live their lives,
            and it is this: life is a shit sandwich, but the more bread you&apos;ve got,
            the less shit you have to eat.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Header Level Two&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            These people are often selfish brats as kids, and they don&apos;t get better
            with age: think of the shifty-eyed smarmy asshole from the sixth form
            who grow up to be a merchant banker, or an estate agent, or one of the
            Conservative Party funny-handshake mine&apos;s a Rolex brigade.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h3&gt;Header Level Three&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            (This isn&apos;t to say that all estate agents, or merchant bankers, or conservatives
            are selfish, but that these are ways of life that provide opportunities
            of a certain disposition to enrich themselves at the expense of others. Bear with me.)
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Header Level Four&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            There is another philosophy by which people live their lives,
            and it goes thus: You will do as I say or I will hurt you.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h5&gt;Header Level Five&lt;/h5&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Let me draw you a Venn diagram with two circles on it, denoting sets of individuals.
            They overlap: the greedy ones and the authoritarian ones.
            Let&apos;s shade in the intersecting area in a different color and label it: dangerous.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h6&gt;Header Level Six&lt;/h6&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Greed isn&apos;t automatically dangerous on its own, and petty authoritarians aren&apos;t
            usually dangerous outside their immediate vicinity &amp;mdash; but when you combine the two,
            you get gangsters and dictators and hate-spewing preachers.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

    <h5>So Boring. Dying. </h5>

    <p>
        Do we really have to go over every single
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
        tag?
    </p>
    <p> <em>Yes.</em> Yes we do. </p>
    <p>
        It's important. Every webpage is built out of this stuff.
    </p>

    <h5> These Basic HTML Sites Look Nothing Like Real Websites </h5>

    <p>
        We're going to get to that, soon!
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is only part of
        the whole story, here &mdash; in order to look good, we also need
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> files to apply
        style and pizzazz to our page.
    </p>

    <div class='figure'>
        <p>This is what the New York Times looks like without style:</p>

        <img src="images/chapter3/ny_post.png">

        <p>Okay, that was a cheap shot. I mean, this is what the New York
            Times looks like without <em>a <abbr title='Cascading Style Sheet'>CSS</abbr> stylesheet</em>:

        <img src="images/chapter3/nyt2.png">

        <p>
            That's not much, right? Now let's look at what it looks like
            with a stylesheet:

        <img src="images/chapter3/nyt3.png">

        <p>
            Wow! Much classier! We're going to be covering
            <abbr title='Cascading Style Sheets'>CSS</abbr> in our
            next chapter, but we need to understand vanilla
            <abbr title='HyperText Markup Language'>HTML</abbr> first!
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the rules of good web design is that the
            <abbr title='HyperText Markup Language'>HTML</abbr> of a page should
            be as clean to read without <abbr title='Cascading Style Sheets'>CSS</abbr>
            as it is with it &mdash; some users, especially the visually impaired, use
            the raw <abbr title='HyperText Markup Language'>HTML</abbr> of a page
            without any additional style.

    <h5>Tables </h5>
    <p>
        Sometimes we need to display a table of data.
        Tables have rows, columns, and headers.

                &lt;th&gt;Fries&lt;/th&gt;
                &lt;th&gt;Chips&lt;/th&gt;
                &lt;th&gt;Smoothies&lt;/th&gt;
                &lt;th&gt;Real&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;Potato&lt;/td&gt; &lt;!-- td means "table data" --&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;No&lt;/td&gt;

                &lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;Beet&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;No&lt;/td&gt;

        <code>td</code> and <code>th</code> elements always go

        <h3>Building Everything With Just Tables</h3>
        <p>
            Some time ago, some enterprising graphic designers
            noticed that <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
            tables bore more than a passing resemblance to a concept
            from graphic design called the
            <a href='https://www.designersinsights.com/designer-resources/using-layout-grids-effectively/'>layout grid</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's <em>possible</em> to build complex layouts with
            nothing but vanilla
            <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
            and tables, but in modern web development this is
            <strong>highly discouraged</strong>.
        </p>
    </div>


    <h5>Special Characters</h5>

    <p>
        Certain characters, like <code>&amp;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>,
        are used in <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
        markup.
    </p>

    <p>
        We cannot simply type the <code>&lt;</code> character into our
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> &mdash;
        the browser would confuse it for the start of an
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tag.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead, we need to use a special escaping syntax:
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp">HTML Entities</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The ampersand character, <code>&amp;</code>, can be
        represented with <code>&amp;amp;</code>.
        The "greater than" character, <code>&gt;</code>, can
        be represented with <code>&amp;gt</code>.
        The "less than" character, <code>&lt;</code>, can
        be represented with <code>&amp;lt</code>.
        With these three entities, we can represent any
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> characters
        that we come across.
    </p>

    <p>
        Special characters can represent more than just
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> characters,
        though! There are many special typographic characters that
        just don't exist on the keyboard, like "&mdash;" (<code>&amp;mdash;</code>),
        "&copy;" (<code>&amp;copy;</code>), and "&euro;" (<code>&amp;euro;</code>).
    </p>

    <p>
        On top of that, if we don't want to enter Unicode characters, we
        can always reference them directly by their Unicode code point, like
        "&#10084;" (<code>&amp;#10084;</code>), "&#3424;" (<code>&amp;#3424;</code>)
        or "&#129304;"(<code>&amp;#129304</code>).
    </p>

    <div class='left-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='left-aside aside'>
        <p>
            Lots of useful icons in Unicode.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h5>Emphasis and Strong</h5>

    <p>
        This one's going to be really quick. Sometimes, you want to <em>emphasize text</em>
        or <strong>really, really emphasize text</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is where the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> (for emphasis) and <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> (for strong emphasis) tags shine.
    </p>

    <p> Figure them out on your own time. I'm not yer' daddy. </p>

    <h5>Links </h5>

    <p>
        Do you know what would make a lot of sense? If the
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tag for
        links between pages was <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>.
    </p>

    <div class='right-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='right-aside aside'>
        <p>
            It's important not to confuse the term "Link"
            with this video game character:
        </p>
        <img src="images/chapter3/zelda.png" title="Princess Link">
        <p>
            This is Princess Link, from the Zelda video games.
            As the brave warrior, Zelda, you have to rescue her
            from <em>bad voice acting</em>.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        But <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> was already taken, so instead,
        a <em>link</em> to another page is represented with the
        <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag. Which stands for <strong>anchor</strong>.
    </p>

    <div class='left-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='left-aside aside'>
        <img src="images/chapter3/anchor.jpg" alt="An anchor">
        <p>
            Pictured: an anchor, linking two webpages together <em>obviously</em>.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        So, if we wanted to construct a link to, say,
        <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0nuQ5o2DYU'>a video
        about the death of Flash from the point of view of some
        characters who were animated in Flash</a>, I'd need to use an
        <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag, like so:
    </p>

    <pre>
    <code class='html'>
        &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0nuQ5o2DYU"&gt; a video about the
            death of Flash from the point of view of some
            characters who were animated in Flash &lt;/a&gt;
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        Yeah, that's right, the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>
        is encoded in an attribute called <code>href</code>.
        This whole deal is just a cascade of nonsense. It's possible to
        connect all of these details with minutiae in the history of
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, but I think
        it's easier just to remember "links are <code>a href=</code>" without
        trying to justify it.
    </p>

    <h6>Absolute vs. Relative Links </h6>

    <p>
        There are two different ways to link to content.
        These linking rules apply to anything that we might link to &mdash;
        other web pages, images, videos, stylesheets &mdash;
        the rules are the same for all of them.
    </p>

    <p>
        An <strong>absolute</strong> link is a full
        <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>,
        like the one that we saw in the first chapter, with protocol,
        domain, and path.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of these:
        <code>http://buildatheweb.com/images/chapter3/hot_dog.jpg</code>
    </p>

    <p>
        As we've established, this refers to <code>/images/chapter3/hot_dog.jpg</code>
        on the domain <code>buildatheweb.com</code> using the <code>http</code> protocol.
    </p>

    <p>
        A <strong>relative</strong> link is a link that contains
        less information, and depends on context to resolve the full
        <abbr title='Uniform Resource Locator'>URL</abbr>.
        The rules of resolving relative links can be a little bit complicated,
        but it's almost always a better idea to use relative links
        rather than absolute ones when we are building webpages, because if we
        leave information like the domain name and protocol out of our
        links, we can change these things more easily.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is particularly useful because <em>when we are developing our
        web sites, we usually do not have a domain name, yet</em>.
        Even if we do, it's common practice to develop our site on
        our personal computer, without a domain name, before launching
        it to our <em>production</em> server, where it does have
        a domain name &mdash; so, relative links are important.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first rule of relative links is that they always resolve to
        the same domain as the source page. I cannot, for example,
        create a relative link to a <code>youtube.com</code> page
        from <code>buildatheweb.com</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        That means, though, that if we wanted to link to <code>/images/chapter3/hot_dog.jpg</code>,
        but we know that this file is going to be on the same
        domain and protocol as the place that we are linking from,
        we can just leave out the domain and protocol entirely,
        and include a link to <code>/images/chapter3/hot_dog.jpg</code>.
    </p>

    <pre>
    <code class='html'>
        &lt;!-- these links go to the same place --&gt;
        &lt;a href='http://buildatheweb.com/images/chapter3/hot_dog.jpg'&gt;Hot Dog&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;a href='/images/chapter3/hot_dog.jpg'&gt;Hot Dog&lt;/a&gt;
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        The <code>/</code> at the beginning of the relative link communicates
        the web root &mdash; in the case of this page, the web root is
        <code>buildatheweb.com/</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        If we leave out the web root (represented by the initial <code>/</code> character)
        we instead ask the web server to construct the link
        starting at the folder that we are <em>currently in</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Which means that, because we are already at the web root,
        we could link to <code>images/chapter3/hot_dog.jpg</code>
        and it, again, would refer to the same file.
    </p>

    <pre>
    <code class='html'>
        &lt;!-- these links go to the same place --&gt;
        &lt;a href='http://buildatheweb.com/images/chapter3/hot_dog.jpg'&gt;Hot Dog&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;a href='/images/chapter3/hot_dog.jpg'&gt;Hot Dog&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;a href='images/chapter3/hot_dog.jpg'&gt;Hot Dog&lt;/a&gt;
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        However, let's now imagine that our
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> file is located
        in the <code>/images</code> directory.
        The first two links would stay the same &mdash; the absolute link
        and the relative link that references the web root &mdash; but
        the relative link that didn't start with <code>/</code>
        would no longer be rooted at the same
        directory. It would become invalid.
    </p>

    <pre>
    <code class='html'>
        &lt;!-- these links go to the same place --&gt;
        &lt;a href='http://buildatheweb.com/images/chapter3/hot_dog.jpg'&gt;Hot Dog&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;a href='/images/chapter3/hot_dog.jpg'&gt;Hot Dog&lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;!-- because we are already in the images directory,
                this link would go to the wrong place: /images/images/chapter3/hot_dog.jpg --&gt;
        &lt;a href='images/chapter3/hot_dog.jpg'&gt;Hot Dog&lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;!-- this would fix the problem --&gt;
        &lt;a href='chapter3/hot_dog.jpg'&gt;Hot Dog&lt;/a&gt;
    </code>
    </pre>

    <h5>Images</h5>

    <p>
        Links are all well and good, but let's get our hands dirty with
        some honest-to-goodness multimedia content. Images!
    </p>

    <p> Images can be rendered with the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag, which works a lot like the
        <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag, but with <code>src</code> instead of <code>href</code>.</p>

    <pre>
    <code class='html'>
        &lt;!-- images work like links but use 'src' instead of 'href' --&gt;
        &lt;img src='http://buildatheweb.com/images/chapter3/hot_dog.jpg'&gt;
        &lt;img src='/images/chapter3/hot_dog.jpg'&gt;
        &lt;img src='images/chapter3/hot_dog.jpg'&gt;
    </code>
    </pre>

    <div class='right-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='right-aside aside'>
        <h4>Base-64 Inline</h4>
        <p>
            In modern browsers, you can even convert your image into Base64 and include
            it in the HTML itself, using a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme">Data URI</a>.

        to help the visually impaired.

        <h4>Image Formats And You</h4>
        <p>
            If we're going to post pictures to the internet, we're quickly going to run abreast
            of the myriad different image formats that exist, the most popular of which include
            <abbr title="Bitmap">BMP</abbr>,
            <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr>,
            <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr>,
            and
            <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each format has its strengths and weaknesses &mdash;
            <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> files are great at reproducing
            photographic images but terrible for text content, <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>
            files can be animated but are limited to 256 colors at best,
            <abbr title="Bitmap">BMP</abbr> files are great when it's 1995...
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>When in doubt, just use a <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr> file.</strong>
            It's the most versatile mix of compression and clarity for <em>most</em> purposes.

        <h4>Image Editing Tools</h4>
        <p>
            If we're going to add images to our websites, we're going to want
            some tools that make editing images and exporting them in a
            wide variety of formats easier.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a free, powerful image editing program, I recommend
            <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>, the GNU Image Editing Program.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I use and pay for Adobe Photoshop, I can't in good faith
            recommend it &mdash;
            it's expensive and only runs on Mac and Windows.
        </p>
    </div>


    <h5> Divisions, Sections, and Asides </h5>

    <p>
        We're not <em>really</em> going to talk about divisions and sections until we get to the chapter on CSS.
    </p>

    <p>
        For now, I'm just going to say that the <code>div</code>, <code>section</code>,
        <code>nav</code>, and <code>aside</code> tags are all <em>invisible</em> tags that we wrap around
        other content.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>"Why even bother with invisible tags?"</em> &mdash; well, they're useful for grouping content
        together for styling!
    </p>


    <p>
        They're important, but they're not really visible until we start to style things.
    </p>

    <h5> Audio &amp; Video </h5>

    <p>
        It's possible to embed both audio and video content in the browser. This is a relatively
        new feature.
    </p>

    <div class='left-aside-arrow'> </div>
    <div class='left-aside aside'>
        <p>
            Be careful with the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag &mdash;
            at some point it was decided by a committee of elders that
            websites with sound were hopelessly tacky.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Let's look at some!
    </p>

    <pre>
    <code class='html'>

&lt;audio controls&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;horse.ogg&quot; type=&quot;audio/ogg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;horse.mp3&quot; type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot;&gt;
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
&lt;/audio&gt;

&lt;video width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; controls&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;movie.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;movie.webm&quot; type=&quot;video/webm&quot;&gt;
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
&lt;/video&gt;

    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        The <code>audio</code> and <code>video</code> tags work a little bit differently
        than the <code>img</code> tag. Instead of having just one <code>src</code> attribute,
        these tags wrap multiple <code>source</code> tags that each have their own <code>src</code>
        attribute.
    </p>

    <p>
        The reason for this is that the browser can cycle through the various sources until
        it finds a source type that it supports &mdash; not all browsers support all of the different
        audio and video types.
        If a browser is too old to understand
        the <code>audio</code> or <code>video</code> tag, it will just display the text
        contained within the tag: "Your browser does not support the video tag".
    </p>

    <p>
        Like with images, there are lots of different potential file formats for both audio and video files.
    </p>

    <h4> iFrames </h4>

    <p>
        <code>frame</code> was a tag that allowed for webpages to be constructed
        out of parts of other pages.
    </p>

    <p>
        Frames aren't a thing anymore, though. They're no longer part of the
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
        specification. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_(World_Wide_Web)">Frames are dead.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        What remains is the concept of the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> &mdash; the inline frame.
    </p>

    <p>
        It allows for a webpage to be embedded within a webpage.
    </p>

    <iframe src="ex10.html"> </iframe>

    <pre>
    <code class='html'>
 &lt;iframe src=&quot;ex10.html&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;

    </code>
    </pre>


    <h4> Many More Tags </h4>

    <p>
        I feel like we've covered enough <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
        tags that we can get a good start on building a webpage,
        but there are lots of other tags, like <code>abbr</code>, <code>form</code>, and <code>input</code>
        that we'll have to touch on in later chapters.
    </p>

    <p> <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp'>Here's a list of tags</a>.</p>

    <h3> HTML Validation </h3>

    <p>
        How do we know if we've built our <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> page correctly?
        There are so many rules and we don't even <em>know</em> half of them yet.
    </p>

    <p>
        One helpful way to know if we've built our websites <em>properly</em> is to run them through
        a <strong>validator</strong>, which will check our <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
        for common errors. <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">This one, from the W3C, is a good choice</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here's the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fbutts.work%2F">validation report for
            <strong>this</strong> site</a>. If I've done my job, this should be completely empty, although
            I can guarantee you that it is probably not.

    <h2> Chapter 4 - Cascading Style Sheets </h2>

    <p>
        It's all well and good to be able to author webpages, but we've come to expect
        a little more graphical acuity from the modern internet. A little more punch.
        A little more pizzazz. A touch more razzamatazz.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> language is all about styling things.
    </p>

    <h3>The Content Stays the Same</h3>

    <p>
        One of the foundational rules of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> design is that
        the content should be laid out in a way that makes styling it easy, but also that the
        content should be laid out in such a way that the theme could <em>completely</em> change without
        touching the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> at all.
    </p>

    <p>
        The site <a href='http://www.csszengarden.com/214/'>CSS Zen Garden</a>
        has the exact same content rendered a few hundred different ways, using nothing but a succession
        of different stylesheets.
    </p>

    <h3>CSS is Made of Many Small Rules</h3>

    <p>
        <abbr title='Cascading Style Sheets'>CSS</abbr> is composed of many small rules, each responsible
        for the display rules controlling a handful of elements.
    </p>

    <p>
        A <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> rule is composed of two parts:
        the <strong>selector</strong> and <strong>properties</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <strong>selector</strong> is a part of the CSS rule that defines which
        <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tags we are interested in
        targeting &mdash; for example, <em>all header tags</em> or <em>just the h1 tag</em> or <em>paragraph text</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <strong>properties</strong> are a set of rules that define how to display
        the object &mdash; for example, <em>should be blue</em> or <em>should be really big</em>.
    </p>

    <h3>Selectors</h3>

    <p>
        So, let's create a <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> rule that
        defines that <em>just the <code>h1</code> tag</em> should be <em>really blue</em> and <em>really big</em>.
    </p>

    <pre>
    <code class='css'>
h1 {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 300%;
}
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        Here, the <code>h1</code> is the selector, and everything between the curly braces are the properties.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's add this rule to our HTML file and watch it in action.
        We can do this with the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag.
    </p>

    <pre>
    <code class='html'>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;CSS Example&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;CSS&quot;&gt;
        &lt;style&gt;
            h1{
                color: blue;
                font-size: 300%;
            }
        &lt;/style&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt; Hello, world. &lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Well would you look at that? That h1 element is big and blue! &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
    </code>
    </pre>

    <iframe src="ex11.html"></iframe>

    <p>Success! We've applied <code>color:blue;</code> and <code>font-size:300%</code> to the <code>h1</code> tag!</p>

    <h4>Classes and IDs</h4>

    <p>
        Sometimes, we want to be able to select a very specific <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
        tag, or a specific group of tags, and simple selection rules just don't cut it.
    </p>

    <p>
        An <strong>ID</strong> allows us to mark a <em>single</em> element,
        and a <strong>class</strong> allows us to mark a whole <em>group</em> of elements.
    </p>

    <div class='figure'>
        <h4>With a Little Help From Our Friends</h4>

        <p>
            The selector library allows us to select all sorts of things on a webpage to apply
            different styles to them. We're going to talk about that a little more, but
            the best way to learn this topic, I think, is interactively.
