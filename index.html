    <h2> Introduction </h2>

    <p> This is <strong>Build A The Web</strong>, a book devoted to taking you, a person with
    basic programming and computer knowledge, and upgrading you into a web programmer. </p>

            While Richard Stallman is a bit of a dogmatic screwball, the man's seemingly
            able to predict the future with an accuracy we would normally associate with
            prophets, actuaries, or Google.

    <h2> Chapter 1: Request, Response </h2>

    <p>
        Our first chapter is going to focus on what happens behind the scenes when we make
        a web request. What that means is a crash course in computer networking. </p>

    <h3> Uniform Resource Locators </h3>

    <p> Let's start by looking at what happens when we crack open a web browser and
        type in: </p>

    <pre class='code'>https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blinkenlights&amp;action=edit#Etymology</pre>

    <p> This is a <strong>URL</strong>, which stands for <strong>Uniform Resource Locator</strong>.
        Some people might also call this an URI, but if we encounter a person who does this,
        I recommend that we shun then socially until they stop. </p>

    <p> This URL uniquely identifies a document somewhere on someone else's
        computer that we are going to request from that computer. </p>

    <p> This divides into protocol, domain name, path, parameters,
        fragment, locus, and spindle. Memorize all of these terms now. </p>
